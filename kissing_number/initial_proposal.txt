Research Proposal: Algorithmic Optimization for 11-Dimensional Kissing Number Problem

## Problem Statement and Research Goals

The 11-dimensional kissing number problem seeks to determine the maximum number of non-overlapping unit spheres that can simultaneously touch a central sphere. This is a fundamental problem in discrete geometry with applications in coding theory, optimization, and high-dimensional data analysis. Our research focuses on developing systematic algorithmic approaches to discover larger valid sphere configurations.
