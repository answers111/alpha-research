Problem. Arrange n points in [0,1]^d to optimize the dispersion/packing–covering tradeoff. The benchmark metric is
  ratio = (min pairwise distance) / (max pairwise distance)
so that larger ratio is better (values in (0,1]).
Evaluator. Given a program exposing max_min_dis_ratio(n,d), we obtain configurations for (n,d)=(16,2) and (14,3), then report ratio for each case.

Baseline algorithm. The initial program employs enhanced simulated annealing with adaptive cooling, neighbor-repulsion moves, periodic smoothing via k-NN weighted averages, and a local refinement stage. KD-tree acceleration is used for nearest-neighbor queries; hyperparameters adapt to dimension.
