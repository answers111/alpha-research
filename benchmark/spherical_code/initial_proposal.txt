Spherical code (N=30 on S^2): maximize minimum pairwise angle on the unit sphere

Problem definition. Choose N=30 points on S^{2} to maximize the minimum pairwise angle θ_min = min_{i<j} arccos(⟨p_i,p_j⟩).

Constraints. Points are unit vectors (rows normalized). Metric is min_angle in radians.

Optimization goal. Maximize min_angle. The evaluator returns {score, min_angle, n, dimension}. All angles are in radians, and score = min_angle.
Best-known reference (for N=30 on S^2): cos(θ*) ≈ 0.7815518750949873 ⇒ θ* ≈ 0.6736467551690225 rad.

Best-known results (human). On S^2 (3D), small N optima coincide with symmetric polyhedra (e.g., tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedral arrangements). For larger N, best codes come from numerical optimization; exact optimality is known only in limited cases.

Algorithm goal. Construct codes with larger min_angle. This baseline seeds with symmetric configurations and uses farthest-point max–min; stronger methods include energy minimization, projected gradient/coordinate descent, and stochastic max–min refinement.
