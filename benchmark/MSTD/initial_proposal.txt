MSTD (More Sums Than Differences) Benchmark

Objective
- Classical MSTD (enforced): Given A ⊂ {0,1,...,N-1} represented by a 0/1 indicator array of length N,
  maximize the ratio R = |A+A| / |A−A|.
- Score: score = R (higher is better).
- Comparisons should be made under the same N.

Default setup in this benchmark
- N = 30.
- Evaluator enforces A=B (classical setting). If a pair (A,B) is provided, B is ignored and A is used.

Known best for N = 30 (baseline)
- Conway’s MSTD set A = {0,2,3,4,7,11,12,14} yields R ≈ 1.04.
- This is the baseline included in initial_program.py.
- Better ratios may exist for N=30; pushing R upwards is the optimization goal.

Notes
- R>1 is rare and indicates sum-dominance.
- The ratio depends strongly on N; do not compare ratios across different N without a normalization scheme.
- If cross-N comparison is necessary, consider reporting both R and N, or use log R as an auxiliary measure.
