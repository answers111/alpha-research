Kissing number in 11D: maximize valid contact points on the unit sphere

Problem. Given dimension d (here d = 11), construct as many unit vectors as possible on S^{d-1} so that every pair of distinct vectors has inner product ≤ 0.5. Equivalently, these are centers of equal unit spheres touching a central one without violating pairwise angle/packing constraints.

Constraints. Vectors must be unit length; for any distinct i ≠ j, ⟨v_i, v_j⟩ ≤ 0.5.

Optimization goal. Maximize the number of vectors (kissing points). The evaluator verifies unit norms and the 0.5 cap, then reports the count and dimension.

Best-known results (human). In 11D, the current constructive lower bound is 592 (Ganzhinov, PSU(4,2) construction). Upper bounds above 800 exist in the literature (exact best published bound depends on source); we focus on improving the constructive lower bound.

Algorithm goal. Create an algorithm that constructs large valid sets under the above constraints. This program follows a PSU(4,2)-based construction (when ATLAS data are available) yielding 592 in 11D, and otherwise uses a robust randomized MIS-style fallback to produce large valid configurations. The program outputs sphere_centers (unit vectors) for evaluator verification.
