Third-order autocorrelation inequality (C3 upper bound)

Problem. For piecewise-constant nonnegative functions on a fixed support with unit mass, we evaluate an upper bound C_upper_bound derived from the maximum of the autoconvolution (normalized by squared L1 mass). The benchmark score is
  score = 1 / C_upper_bound
so larger score indicates a smaller upper bound and hence a better result.

Evaluator. The evaluator calls find_better_c3_upper_bound() from the target program to obtain step heights, computes the (normalized) autoconvolution maximum, and returns 1/C_upper_bound.

Baseline algorithm. A simple genetic algorithm over height sequences (tournament selection, one-point crossover, Gaussian mutation) serves as the baseline search method.
