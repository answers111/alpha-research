Autoconvolution peak minimization on a unit interval (standard normalization)

Problem definition. Let  

$$
\mathcal{F}=\Big\{\,f\in L^{1}\!\big([-{\tfrac12},{\tfrac12}]\big):\ f\ge 0,\ \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} f(x)\,dx=1\,\Big\}
$$

$$
\qquad
(f*f)(t)=\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x)\,f(t-x)\,dx .
$$

We seek to minimize the peak value of the autoconvolution:
$$
\mu_\infty \;=\; \inf_{f\in\mathcal{F}} \ \|f*f\|_\infty .
$$

Constraints. Nonnegative density, unit mass (L1=1), support length 1 (here taken as [-1/2, 1/2]). In the implementation, f is represented by nonnegative step heights on a uniform grid and normalized to unit integral.

Optimization goal. Minimize \(\mu_\infty = \max_t (f*f)(t)\). Smaller is better.

Best-known human results. In this standard setup, the best currently published bounds are
$$
\boxed{0.64 \ \le\ \mu_\infty \ \le\ 0.75496}\,.
$$
The upper bound traces to work of Matolcsi–Vinuesa (after normalizing support length to 1), and the lower bound to Cloninger–Steinerberger.

Algorithm goal. Create an algorithm that constructs feasible densities with progressively smaller \(\mu_\infty\). This baseline program generates simple analytical candidates (box, triangle, cosine-squared, Gaussian) on a uniform grid, normalizes to unit mass, and computes autoconvolution via FFT to measure \(\mu_\infty\). It serves as a starting point for more advanced search/optimization methods.
