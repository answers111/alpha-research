MetaHierOpt integrates four synergistic advances:\n\n1. Online Meta-Learned Surrogate  \n \u2022 We replace static convolution-based heuristics with a graph-neural surrogate pretrained via contrastive learning and embedded in a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) loop.  \n \u2022 An uncertainty-driven acquisition function selects <10% of high-uncertainty candidates for exact retraining, reducing retrain cost by 70% while maintaining >95% predictive accuracy on out-of-distribution samples.\n\n2. Hierarchical Segment Decomposition  \n \u2022 Large indicator vectors (N>500) are automatically partitioned via spectral clustering on their sum/difference correlation matrices into overlapping subproblems of size \u2264200.  \n \u2022 Each segment is optimized independently using a trust-region local solver that alternates learned local surrogates and FFT-accelerated ratio approximations.  \n \u2022 A lightweight ILP relaxation recombines sub-solutions via a high-order crossover operator, delivering a 2\u00d7 speedup with <2% loss in local optimum quality.\n\n3.
