We propose MetaFlow-GDS, an end-to-end, distributed framework that (i) learns transferable search policies via meta-reinforcement across multiple N regimes, (ii) enriches the proposal space with hierarchical, data-driven operators, and (iii) embeds a heteroscedastic deep-kernel surrogate with adaptive fidelity scheduling. Our four key innovations are:\n\n1. Meta-Reinforcement for Cross-Scale Transfer  \n\u2022 We train a meta-policy over a family of small-N instances (N\u2208{50,100,200}), using multi-task proximal policy optimization to learn initialization priors for GFlowNet parameters and operator-selection weights.  \n\u2022 At deployment, the meta-policy rapidly adapts to new N via just 1\u20132 gradient updates, reducing \u201ccold-start\u201d invalid proposals by 90%.\n\n2. Hierarchical, Learned Operators  \n\u2022 Beyond single\u2010bit swaps, we introduce k-swap clusters and block-motion moves whose subgraph motifs are extracted online via a Graph Attention Network trained on high-reward trajectories.  \n\u2022 A contextual bandit schedules these operators in the GFlowNet sampler, balancing exploration of novel motifs and exploitation of proven patterns, yielding a 3\u00d7 boost in sample efficiency.\n\n3. Heteroscedastic Deep-Kernel Surrogate  \n\u2022 We replace the Gaussian\u2010process\u2010in\u2010latent with a neural deep kernel whose architecture auto-scales its receptive field based on cardinality and graph density.  \n\u2022 The surrogate produces both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimates, driving a two-stage multi-fidelity evaluator: a learned linear projection test, a submodular bound estimator, an...(truncated)\n\n# Previous Program:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.random import default_rng\n\n# For reproducibility\nrng = default_rng(42)\n\n# Compute the sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio for two 0/1 indicator vectors\ndef compute_ratio(A_ind: np.ndarray, B_ind: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio |A+B|/|A\u2212B|.
