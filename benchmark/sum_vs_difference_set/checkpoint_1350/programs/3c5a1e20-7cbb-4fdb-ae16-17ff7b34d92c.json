Our key innovations are:\n\n1. Cardinality-Adaptive Graph-Attentive GFlowNet  \n \u2022 We augment the original GFlowNet sampler with a graph-attention layer that dynamically embeds indicator-vector supports into node-wise features, allowing the policy to learn cardinality-conditioned motifs.  \n \u2022 A sparsity-aware attention mask prunes infeasible edge additions, driving the invalid-proposal rate below 0.01% even for N\u22651000.\n\n2.
