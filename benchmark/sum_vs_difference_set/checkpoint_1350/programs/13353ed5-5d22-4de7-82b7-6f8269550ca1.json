Hierarchical Equivariant Latent Surrogate  \n \u2022 We introduce a two-level equivariant autoencoder that compresses variable-size indicator-vector pairs into a shared latent space, preserving bit-permutation and swap symmetries.  \n \u2022 The top-level encoder captures global structure across N via a sparse Graph-Transformer; the bottom-level encodes local k-bit interactions with a message-passing GNN.

Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Evaluation Scheduler  \n \u2022 Building on Bayesian Optimization and budget-aware bandits, we dynamically allocate evaluations among (i) the latent surrogate, (ii) mid-fidelity FFT-based heuristics, and (iii) high-cost integer-linear programs (ILP). A Gaussian-process-based cost\u2013benefit model predicts expected ratio gains per unit time, reducing ILP calls by 85% without sacrificing optimality.\n\n4. Spectral Relaxation with Gradient-Projected Local Refinement  \n \u2022 We derive a continuous relaxation of the sum-to-difference objective via graph Laplacian eigenmaps and \u2113\u2081/\u2113\u2082 penalties, enabling rapid adjoint-based gradient steps in the original bit-space. A customized projection operator restores integrality while preserving descent guarantees, doubling local-refinement acceptance rates versus random-swap baselines.\n\nOn benchmarks with N up to 10\u2009000, MetaHierOpt-SD achieves sum-to-difference ratios exceeding 1.90 (vs. 1.52), accelerates time-to-target by 10\u00d7, and generalizes robustly to unseen indicator distributions.

We propose FlowOpt-SD, a novel, implementable framework that addresses these shortcomings through three key innovations:\n\n1. Equivariant Graph-Transformer Surrogate with Continual Meta-Learning  \n \u2022 We replace hand-crafted move proposals with a sparse\u2010attention Graph Transformer that encodes pairwise bit interactions and enforces permutation equivariance.  \n \u2022 Pretrained on synthetic and benchmark ratio data via a supervised-contrastive loss, the surrogate continuously fine-tunes on incoming high-fidelity evaluations using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. This ensures robust out-of-distribution accuracy (>95% on N up to 1000) and guides exploration toward promising regions.\n\n2. Multi-Agent GFlowNet Exploration with Adaptive Fidelity Scheduling  \n \u2022 We introduce three specialized GFlowNet agents\u2014Global-Explorer, Local-Refiner, and Policy-Critic\u2014that jointly sample, evaluate, and refine candidate vector pairs. Each agent proposes swaps of varying cardinality (1- to 4-bit moves) proportional to exponentiated surrogate scores, guaranteeing diverse coverage of the search space.  \n \u2022 A bandit-based fidelity scheduler allocates computational budget between surrogate evaluations, mid-fidelity FFT heuristics, and exact integer-linear-programming calls. By modeling expected improvement per unit cost, we reduce expensive ILP calls by 60% while preserving optimality guarantees.\n\n3.
