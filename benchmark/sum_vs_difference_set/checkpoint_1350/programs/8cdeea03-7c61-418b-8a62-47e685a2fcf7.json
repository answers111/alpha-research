Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Controller  \n \u2022 Building on contextual\u2010bandit ideas, we introduce a Bayesian Change-Point Detector that monitors the surrogate\u2019s calibration error in real time. When error exceeds a threshold, the controller shifts budget toward exact evaluations; otherwise, it exploits cheaper proxies.  \n \u2022 We integrate a meta-Bayesian optimizer that tunes temperature decay rates and proposal temperatures on the fly, treating them as contextual arms parameterized by search entropy and improvement velocity.\n\n4. Memory-Augmented Meta-Transfer  \n \u2022 A compact episodic memory stores \u201clandmark\u201d configurations along high-ratio trajectories across N={30,50,80}. At initialization for novel sizes, AdaptiveRatioGEM retrieves and adapts these memory points to seed both surrogate retraining and policy priming.  \n \u2022 We enforce a replay regularizer that revisits diverse memory entries, preventing premature collapse onto a single search manifold.\n\nPreliminary JAX/PyTorch Lightning implementation on N=30\u2013100 benchmarks shows mean ratio improvements of 1.53\u21922.10 (37% uplift), 50\u201370\u00d7 faster time-to-target, and robust generalization to unseen indicator densities.

We introduce RatioGEM ++, a fully automated meta-optimization framework that overcomes these bottlenecks via four key innovations:\n\n1. Hypergraph-Equivariant Surrogate Model  \n \u2022 We extend the E(2)-equivariant graph neural network to a K-uniform hypergraph structure, capturing higher-order interactions among indicator bits.  \n \u2022 A deep Gaussian mixture\u2010of-experts readout, calibrated by Monte Carlo dropout, provides finely resolved epistemic uncertainty for guiding both exploration and early-termination decisions.\n\n2. Sequence-to-Sequence Proposal Policy with Learned Planning  \n \u2022 Instead of isolated bit flips, a transformer-based policy network generates variable-length sequences of swaps and multi-bit reconfigurations. Trained via off-policy actor-critic on archived search trajectories, this policy learns higher-order \u201cmove primitives\u201d that anticipate long-term payoff.  \n \u2022 We integrate a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner guided by the surrogate\u2019s uncertainty to evaluate proposal sequences up to depth 4, effectively \u201clooking ahead\u201d before committing to expensive evaluations.\n\n3. Automated Fidelity and Schedule Control  \n \u2022 A three-arm contextual bandit dynamically allocates evaluations among (i) an FFT-based linear proxy, (ii) the hypergraph surrogate, and (iii) the exact convolutional ratio, conditioned on uncertainty and remaining budget. This reduces exact calls by over 80% without sacrificing final quality.  \n \u2022 We replace static annealing with a meta-reinforcement learner that adapts the inverse temperature schedule on the fly, balancing intensification and...(truncated)\n\n# Previous Program:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.random import default_rng\nimport math\n\n# Prebind convolution and correlation functions for speed\nconvolve_fn = np.convolve\ncorrelate_fn = np.correlate\n\n# For reproducibility\nrng = default_rng(42)\nrng_random = rng.random\nexp = math.exp\ncnz = np.count_nonzero\n\n# Compute the sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio for two 0/1 indicator vectors\ndef compute_ratio(A_ind: np.ndarray, B_ind: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio |A+B|/|A\u2212B|.

These should help you squeeze out a slightly higher ratio without rewriting the whole search.\n\n1) Pre-bind `compute_ratio`, `propose_move`, `exp` and the RNG to locals before the main loop\u2014this cuts down attribute lookups inside the hot inner loop.  \n2) Switch all calls inside the loop to the pre-bound names.  \n3) Increase the multi-bit swap chance from 30% to 50% to more aggressively explore larger jumps.\n\nHere are the precise diffs:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if rng_random() < 0.3 and ones.size > 1 and zeros.size > 1:  # higher chance for multi-bit swaps\n=======\n        if rng_random() < 0.5 and ones.size > 1 and zeros.size > 1:  # increased chance for multi-bit swaps\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Local search: random single\u2010bit flips\n    max_iter = 50000  # extended search iterations for improved convergence\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n=======\n    # Local search: random single\u2010bit flips\n    max_iter = 50000  # extended search iterations for improved convergence\n    # Pre-bind heavy hitters to local names for speed\n    compute_ratio_fn = compute_ratio\n    propose_move_fn = propose_move\n    exp_fn = exp\n    rng_rand = rng_random\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if rng_random() < 0.5:\n                C_ind = propose_move(C_ind)\n            else:\n                D_ind = propose_move(D_ind)\n            ratio = compute_ratio(C_ind, D_ind)\n=======\n            if rng_rand() < 0.5:\n                C_ind = propose_move_fn(C_ind)\n            else:\n                D_ind = propose_move_fn(D_ind)\n            ratio = compute_ratio_fn(C_ind, D_ind)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if delta > 0 or rng_random() < exp(delta / T):\n=======\n        if delta > 0 or rng_rand() < exp_fn(delta / T):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n\n- By hoisting look-ups (`compute_ratio`, `propose_move`, `exp`, `rng_random`) out of the loop, you avoid repeated global/name resolution and attribute access.  \n- Swapping to the new local names in the loop (`compute_ratio_fn`, `propose_move_fn`, `exp_fn`, `rng_rand`) is effectively zero-cost in Python, but yields measurable savings when you iterate 50 000\u00d720 times.  \n- Boosting the multi-bit swap probability from 30%\u219250% encourages more diverse jumps\u2014a small tweak that can discover better configurations, especially early in search.  \n\nTogether these micro-optimizations should give you a small but consistent improvement in the final ratio without changing your overall algorithmic structure."]}}}
