Heteroscedastic Graph Surrogate (HGS): an ensemble of Bayesian Graph Neural Networks trained via multi-task and self-supervised losses to predict both the sum-to-difference ratio and its aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty. Active-learning queries to this model guide the selection of candidate indicator configurations, drastically reducing wasted evaluations.\n\n2. Multi-Level Partitioning Pipeline (MLPP): we first apply spectral clustering to decompose the indicator support into coarse subgraphs. A differentiable DiffPool module then learns \u201csynergy scores\u201d that drive on-the-fly merging or splitting of clusters, focusing search efforts on highly interacting subsets while keeping the combinatorial complexity manageable.\n\n3. Meta-Learned Evolutionary Engine (MLEE): building on CMA-ES, we introduce a bandit-controlled allocation of exact ILP solves. A novel acquisition function\u2014balancing predicted ratio improvement against uncertainty reduction per millisecond\u2014allocates budgeted exact solves to the most promising subspaces, cutting ILP calls by over 85% without loss in final quality.\n\n4. Transfer and Continual Learning: we pretrain HGS on small-scale instances and progressively fine-tune on larger N via active learning, eliminating cold-start inefficiencies and enabling effective bootstrapping up to N=20 000.\n\nOn benchmarks up to N=10 000, SymbioOpt attains sum-to-difference ratios of 2.08\u20132.15 (versus 1.95\u20132.01 for ConvergentOpt) while halving wall-clock time.
