Packing circles inside a unit square to maximize sum of radii
Given an integer n, place n disjoint circles in [0,1]^2 to maximize the total sum of radii.

Objective and metric
- Score = total sum of radii (larger is better).
- Validity: circles must be pairwise disjoint and fully inside the unit square.

Notes on records
- This variable-radius “sum of radii” objective is not the classical equal-radius packing; authoritative SOTA tables are not standardized.
- Values reported in code or experiments should be treated as benchmarks rather than literature SOTA.

Goal
- Create algorithms that increase the total sum of radii for n ∈ {26, 32} under the above validity constraints.
