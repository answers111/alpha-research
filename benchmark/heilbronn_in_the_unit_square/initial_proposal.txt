Heilbronn in the unit square: maximize smallest triangle area (n = 16)

Problem definition. Given n = 16 points in [0,1]^2, define Δ(P) as the minimum triangle area over all triples from configuration P. The task is to maximize Δ(P).

Metric (larger is better). Use the raw minimum triangle area:
  score = min_area.
For reference we also report scaled_min_area = n^{8/7 + 1/2000} * min_area (informational only).

Constraints. Points must lie in [0,1]^2.

Evaluator. The evaluator returns {"score" (= min_area), "scaled_min_area", "min_area", "n"}.

Baseline. We use a hexagonal-lattice-inspired construction with light jitter to generate n = 16 points.

Human best. For n = 16, the best known and proven optimal smallest triangle area is A = 7/341 ≈ 0.020526... (see Erich Friedman’s compilation [https://erich-friedman.github.io/packing/heilbronn/]).

Goal. Construct point sets that maximize min_area (and thus also increase scaled_min_area accordingly) for n = 16.
