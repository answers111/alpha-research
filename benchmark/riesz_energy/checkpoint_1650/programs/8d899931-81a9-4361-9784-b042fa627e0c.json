Our contributions address the key weaknesses of existing methods\u2014slow small-n convergence, dense interaction costs, and brittle step\u2010size schedules\u2014through four innovations:\n\n1. Hierarchical DeepSet Initialization with Wavelet Refinement  \n \u2022 Train a DeepSet encoder\u2013decoder on optimal small-n configurations (n\u22641 000) and embed outputs into a multi-resolution wavelet basis.  \n \u2022 Perform top-down Chebyshev interpolation on a logarithmic grid, followed by targeted wavelet corrections at high-energy intervals, reducing initial energy variance by >99% and cutting downstream iterations by half.\n\n2. Spectral-FMM Hybrid Operator for Matrix-Free Newton  \n \u2022 Leverage a kernel-independent fast multipole method (FMM) for long-range interactions and a nonuniform FFT (NUFFT) on discrete cosine bases for near-field gradient/Hessian\u2013vector products.  \n \u2022 Assemble an O(n log n) two-level preconditioner combining low\u2010rank spectral approximations on Chebyshev nodes with a diagonal FMM estimator, maintaining condition numbers \u22481 without forming dense matrices.\n\n3. Self-Tuning Primal\u2013Dual Interior-Point Newton with Adaptive Trust Regions  \n \u2022 Embed a log-barrier whose weight adapts to primal and dual residuals, auto-enforcing point ordering in [0,1] and eliminating hand-tuned penalties.  \n \u2022 Implement a variance-controlled trust-region schedule: begin with subsampled quasi-Newton steps, estimate local curvature via randomized Lanczos, and switch to full inexact Newton once spectral gaps exceed thresholds, ensuring ...(truncated)\n\n# Task\nSuggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.\n\nYou MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)\n=======\n# New replacement code\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExample of valid diff format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(p):\n        for k in range(n):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n=======\n# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern\nfor i in range(m):\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(p):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nYou can suggest multiple changes.
