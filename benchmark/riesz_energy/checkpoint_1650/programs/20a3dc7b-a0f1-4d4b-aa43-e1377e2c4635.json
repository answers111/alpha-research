We propose an implementable, end-to-end pipeline that overcomes these limitations by uniting four innovations:\n\n1. Adaptive Multi-Scale Spectral Smoothing  \n \u2022 Weakness addressed: static \u03c3-annealing cannot navigate deep wells.  \n \u2022 Improvement: introduce a dual\u2010band Fourier surrogate that adaptively splits the energy landscape into coarse and fine scales. An automatic scheduler raises low-frequency smoothing when trust-region acceptance drops, then refines high-frequency detail once descent stabilizes\u2014eliminating hand-tuned \u03c3 schedules.\n\n2. Hierarchical Subspace Trust-Region Newton\u2013CG  \n \u2022 Weakness addressed: diagonal or fixed L-BFGS preconditioners ignore evolving coupling.  \n \u2022 Improvement: maintain a block-diagonal plus low-rank Hessian approximation in a nested k-dimensional subspace. Solve trust-region subproblems via truncated CG with an adaptive radius derived from a curvature\u2010informed merit model, achieving O(nk + k^2n) cost and guaranteeing step acceptance via a Weyl\u2010bound estimate.\n\n3. Energy-Aware Normalizing Flow Multi-Start  \n \u2022 Weakness addressed: uniform jitter offers poor coverage and wastes iterations.  \n \u2022 Improvement: train a permutation-equivariant normalizing flow conditioned on both configuration and local energy gradient norms. At runtime, sample M\u226bK candidates, rapidly pre-screen via a lightweight graph-neural surrogate to predict descent potential, and launch the top-K seeds into the trust-region solver for parallel refinement.\n\n4. Self-Tuning Control and Mixed\u2010Precision Acceleration  \n \u2022 Weakness addressed: manual hyperparameter tuning and high compute cost at scale.  \n \u2022 Improvement: integrate Bayesian line\u2010search for learning rate and trust-radius adaptation, and exploit mixed FP16/FP32 for Hessian\u2013vector products and FFTs.  \n\nWe will deliver a JAX/C++/CUDA library with automatic differentiation, on\u2010the\u2010fly FFTs, and PyTorch\u2010style flow training.

Our proposal, Spectral-Trust, addresses these shortcomings by integrating three novel, mutually reinforcing components into a single, implementable pipeline:\n\n1. Spectral Energy Annealing with Data-Driven \u03c3-Control  \n \u2022 Weakness: Fixed jitter and first-order smoothing fail to traverse deep energy wells.  \n \u2022 Improvement: Introduce a random-Fourier-feature surrogate to define a smoothed energy E\u03c3(x), with \u03c3 decreased only when the ratio of accepted trust-region steps falls below a target threshold. This balances exploration against convergence, systematically lowering barriers without manual hyperparameter tuning.\n\n2. Limited-Memory Subspace Trust-Region Newton-CG  \n \u2022 Weakness: Diagonal Hessian preconditioners ignore curvature coupling and suffer small steps in ill-conditioned directions.  \n \u2022 Improvement: Maintain an L-BFGS curvature history to span a k-dimensional dominant subspace and solve the trust-region subproblem via conjugate-gradient with an adaptive radius \u03c1. This achieves O(nk + k^2n) cost per iteration, recovers second-order efficiency, and adapts automatically to local geometry.\n\n3. Generative Flow Warm-Start and Surrogate Screening  \n \u2022 Weakness: Uniform jitter initialization yields limited diversity and high failure rate.  \n \u2022 Improvement: Train a permutation-equivariant normalizing flow on optimal small-n configurations. At runtime, sample M candidates in O(M\u2009n\u2009log\u2009n), pre-screen via a low-cost surrogate, and refine the top-K proposals in the trust-region solver.
