This approximates a Newton step direction (Jacobi preconditioner) and should dramatically improve convergence, especially in the stiff, near\u2010singular regime where ordinary momentum methods stall around 1e-3.\n- **Epsilon safeguard**: `+1e-6` prevents division by zero when points coalesce.\n\nThese changes keep everything inside Numba fast\u2010paths and aim to reduce the iteration count and push the final energy well below the 1e-3 plateau."]}}}
