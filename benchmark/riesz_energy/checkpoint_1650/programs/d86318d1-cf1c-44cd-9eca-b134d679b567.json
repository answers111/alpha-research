Merge `compute_energy` and `compute_grad` into one `compute_energy_and_grad` Numba function.  \n2. Remove the now\u2010redundant `compute_grad`.  \n3. Update `optimize` to call the new combined function, storing both energy and gradient, and reusing them across backtracking steps.  \n4. Adjust `main` to unpack energy from the new function when reporting.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n@njit(cache=True, parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_energy(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute Riesz s-energy via direct double loop (numba accelerated, parallel).\"\"\"\n    n = xs.size\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0.0\n    ene = 0.0\n    for i in prange(n - 1):\n        xi = xs[i]\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            ene += abs(xi - xs[j]) ** (-s)\n    return ene\n=======\n@njit(cache=True, parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_energy_and_grad(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0):\n    \"\"\"Compute Riesz s-energy and its gradient via direct double loop (numba accelerated, parallel).\"\"\"\n    n = xs.size\n    ene = 0.0\n    grad = np.zeros(n)\n    if n < 2:\n        return ene, grad\n    for i in prange(n - 1):\n        xi = xs[i]\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            dx = xi - xs[j]\n            adx = abs(dx)\n            inv = adx ** (-s)\n            ene += inv\n            # gradient contribution for pair (i,j)\n            coeff = -s * dx * (adx ** (-s - 2))\n            grad[i] += coeff\n            grad[j] -= coeff\n    return ene, grad\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n@njit(cache=True, parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_grad(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Compute gradient of Riesz s-energy via explicit loops (numba accelerated).\"\"\"\n    n = xs.size\n    grad = np.zeros(n)\n    if n < 2:\n        return grad\n    for i in prange(n):\n        xi = xs[i]\n        g = 0.0\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j:\n                dx = xi - xs[j]\n                adx = abs(dx)\n                # -s * sign(dx) * adx^(-s-1) == -s * dx * adx^(-s-2)\n                g -= s * dx * (adx ** (-s - 2))\n        grad[i] = g\n    return grad\n=======\n# Removed separate compute_grad: gradient is now produced by compute_energy_and_grad\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef optimize(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0, lr: float = 1e-2, iters: int = 2000, tol: float = 1e-8) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Projected gradient descent with backtracking line search and lr decay.\"\"\"\n    # Copy inputs and initialize energy and store initial learning rate\n    xs = xs.copy()\n    prev_energy = compute_energy(xs, s)\n    lr0 = lr  # keep the original lr for adaptive decay\n    for iteration in range(1, iters + 1):\n        grad = compute_grad(xs, s)\n        grad_norm = np.linalg.norm(grad)\n        if grad_norm < tol:\n            break\n        step = lr\n        # backtracking line search\n        for _ in range(8):\n            xs_candidate = np.clip(xs - step * grad, 0.0, 1.0)\n            energy_candidate = compute_energy(xs_candidate, s)\n            if energy_candidate < prev_energy:\n                xs = xs_candidate\n                prev_energy = energy_candidate\n                break\n            step *= 0.5\n        else:\n            # failed to decrease energy\n            break\n        # adapt the step size by 1/\u221aiteration for robust diminishing steps\n        lr = lr0 / np.sqrt(iteration + 1)\n    # ensure the result is sorted before returning\n    xs.sort()\n    return xs\n=======\ndef optimize(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0, lr: float = 1e-2, iters: int = 2000, tol: float = 1e-8) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Projected gradient descent with backtracking line search and lr decay.\"\"\"\n    xs = xs.copy()\n    energy, grad = compute_energy_and_grad(xs, s)\n    initial_lr = lr\n    tol_sq = tol * tol\n\n    for iteration in range(1, iters + 1):\n        # check squared gradient norm against squared tolerance\n        if np.dot(grad, grad) < tol_sq:\n            break\n\n        step_size = lr\n        # backtracking line search\n        for _ in range(8):\n            xs_candidate = np.clip(xs - step_size * grad, 0.0, 1.0)\n            candidate_energy, candidate_grad = compute_energy_and_grad(xs_candidate, s)\n            if candidate_energy < energy:\n                xs, energy, grad = xs_candidate, candidate_energy, candidate_grad\n                break\n            step_size *= 0.5\n        else:\n            # failed to decrease energy\n            break\n\n        # adapt the step size by 1/\u221aiteration for robust diminishing steps\n        lr = initial_lr / np.sqrt(iteration + 1)\n\n    xs.sort()\n    return xs\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # report final energy\n    print(\"Final Riesz s-energy:\", compute_energy(xs_local, s))\n=======\n    # report final energy\n    energy, _ = compute_energy_and_grad(xs_local, s)\n    print(\"Final Riesz s-energy:\", energy)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}}
