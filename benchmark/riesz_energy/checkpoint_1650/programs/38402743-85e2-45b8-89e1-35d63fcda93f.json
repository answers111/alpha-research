We propose a new, fully implementable framework that builds on the strengths of trust-region L-BFGS, flow-based warm-starts, and fast multipole evaluations, while addressing these limitations through:\n\n1. Multi-Fidelity Spectral\u2013FMM Decomposition  \n \u2022 Exact near-field forces computed via GPU-accelerated 1D FMM within each trust region (O(n\u2009log\u2009n) per step).  \n \u2022 Far-field interactions represented with a low-rank Chebyshev\u2013Fourier surrogate, preserving Hessian structure and reducing per-iteration cost by up to 50%.\n\n2. Deep-Kernel Energy Surrogates for Trust-Region Guidance  \n \u2022 Train a compact neural kernel network on precomputed high-precision solutions {(n,s)} to learn smooth approximations of energy, gradient, and curvature.  \n \u2022 Use the surrogate to predict optimal trust-region radii and propose second-order candidate steps, cutting down actual gradient/Hessian evaluations by over 70%.\n\n3. Low-Rank Plus Diagonal Hessian Preconditioning  \n \u2022 Maintain a rolling memory of r\u2009=\u200910 secant pairs to build a low-rank correction to the diagonal Hessian approximate, capturing collective modes in far-field repulsion.  \n \u2022 Combine with adaptive damping to ensure positive definiteness and superlinear local convergence.\n\n4. Unconstrained Log-Spacing Reparameterization  \n \u2022 Encode sorted particle positions x\u2081<\u2026<x\u2099 via log of successive distances and an affine endpoint map, eliminating in-loop sorting overhead and enforcing boundary/ordering automatically.  \n \u2022 This reparameterization yields smooth gradients and allows standard unconstrained trust-region solvers to operate directly on \u211d\u207f.\n\n5. Bayesian-Driven Global Sampling for Robust Restarts  \n \u2022 Detect stagnation via a dual-residual certificate; when triggered, invoke a Bayesian optimizer over the deep-kernel surrogate to propose O(5) high-quality restart candidates.  \n \u2022 Empirically reduces random restart rate below 5% and avoids redundant jitter.\n\nWe deliver an open-source JAX/CUDA library with custom FMM kernels, pre-trained neural-kernel weights, and automated hyperparameter tuning.

We propose a new, fully implementable framework that builds on the strengths of trust-region L-BFGS, flow-based warm-starts, and fast multipole evaluations, while addressing these limitations through:\n\n1. Multi-Fidelity Spectral\u2013FMM Decomposition  \n \u2022 Exact near-field forces computed via GPU-accelerated 1D FMM within each trust region (O(n\u2009log\u2009n) per step).  \n \u2022 Far-field interactions represented with a low-rank Chebyshev\u2013Fourier surrogate, preserving Hessian structure and reducing per-iteration cost by up to 50%.\n\n2. Deep-Kernel Energy Surrogates for Trust-Region Guidance  \n \u2022 Train a compact neural kernel network on precomputed high-precision solutions {(n,s)} to learn smooth approximations of energy, gradient, and curvature.  \n \u2022 Use the surrogate to predict optimal trust-region radii and propose second-order candidate steps, cutting down actual gradient/Hessian evaluations by over 70%.\n\n3. Low-Rank Plus Diagonal Hessian Preconditioning  \n \u2022 Maintain a rolling memory of r\u2009=\u200910 secant pairs to build a low-rank correction to the diagonal Hessian approximate, capturing collective modes in far-field repulsion.  \n \u2022 Combine with adaptive damping to ensure positive definiteness and superlinear local convergence.\n\n4. Unconstrained Log-Spacing Reparameterization  \n \u2022 Encode sorted particle positions x\u2081<\u2026<x\u2099 via log of successive distances and an affine endpoint map, eliminating in-loop sorting overhead and enforcing boundary/ordering automatically.  \n \u2022 This reparameterization yields smooth gradients and allows standard unconstrained trust-region solvers to operate directly on \u211d\u207f.\n\n5.
