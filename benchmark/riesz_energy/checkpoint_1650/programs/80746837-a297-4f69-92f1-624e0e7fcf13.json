The first one factors out the repeated arithmetic in the inner loop of `compute_grad` (by pre-computing `inv_exp = s+2` and `coeff = -s`), which reduces work per iteration. The second patch adds a simple homotopy continuation (`homotopy_optimize`) in `main` to progressively \u201cramp\u201d s from a small value up to the target 1.0. In practice this often finds a lower\u2010energy configuration than jumping directly to s=1.\n\nPlease apply both patches.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n@njit(cache=True, parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_grad(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Compute gradient of Riesz s-energy via explicit loops (numba accelerated).\"\"\"\n    n = xs.size\n    grad = np.zeros(n)\n    if n < 2:\n        return grad\n    for i in prange(n):\n        xi = xs[i]\n        g = 0.0\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j:\n                dx = xi - xs[j]\n                adx = abs(dx)\n                # -s * sign(dx) * adx^(-s-1) == -s * dx * adx^(-s-2)\n                g -= s * dx * (adx ** (-s - 2))\n        grad[i] = g\n    return grad\n=======\n@njit(cache=True, parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_grad(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Compute gradient of Riesz s-energy via explicit loops (numba accelerated).\"\"\"\n    n = xs.size\n    grad = np.zeros(n)\n    if n < 2:\n        return grad\n    inv_exp = s + 2.0      # precompute exponent (was -s-2)\n    coeff = -s             # pull out the -s factor\n    for i in prange(n):\n        xi = xs[i]\n        g = 0.0\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j:\n                dx = xi - xs[j]\n                adx = abs(dx)\n                # now: g += coeff * dx * adx**(-inv_exp)\n                g += coeff * dx * adx ** (-inv_exp)\n        grad[i] = g\n    return grad\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n---\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef main() -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Run a sample optimization for n=20, s=1.0 and return final points.\"\"\"\n    n: int = 20\n    s: float = 1.0\n    # initialize with jittered baseline\n    xs_init: np.ndarray = jittered_baseline(n, seed=0, jitter=1e-3)\n    # run projected gradient descent\n    xs_local: np.ndarray = optimize(xs_init, s, lr=1e-2, iters=500)\n    # report final energy\n    print(\"Final Riesz s-energy:\", compute_energy(xs_local, s))\n    return xs_local\n=======\n# add homotopy continuation to gradually ramp s from small\u21921.0\ndef homotopy_optimize(xs_init: np.ndarray, s_final: float, num_stages: int = 8,\n                      lr: float = 1e-2, iters: int = 200, tol: float = 1e-8) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Perform continuation over s to improve convergence at s_final.\"\"\"\n    xs = xs_init.copy()\n    # start from a small s and slowly increase\n    for s_curr in np.linspace(0.1, s_final, num_stages):\n        xs = optimize(xs, s_curr, lr=lr, iters=iters, tol=tol)\n    return xs\n\ndef main() -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Run a sample optimization for n=20, s=1.0 and return final points.\"\"\"\n    n: int = 20\n    s: float = 1.0\n    # initialize with jittered baseline\n    xs_init: np.ndarray = jittered_baseline(n, seed=0, jitter=1e-3)\n    # run homotopy-accelerated optimization (often finds lower-energy states)\n    xs_local: np.ndarray = homotopy_optimize(xs_init, s, num_stages=10,\n                                             lr=1e-2, iters=200, tol=1e-8)\n    # report final energy\n    print(\"Final Riesz s-energy:\", compute_energy(xs_local, s))\n    return xs_local\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n\n- In `compute_grad`, by hoisting out the `-s` factor and precomputing the exponent (`s+2`), we remove two floating-point operations per inner iteration.\n- The new `homotopy_optimize` drives the solver through a sequence of smaller-s problems, which can dramatically improve the ultimate configuration at `s=1.0` (i.e., lower final energy, higher 1/energy metric)."]}}}
