Our contributions are fourfold:\n\n1. Multistage s-Annealing.  Rather than tackling the singular s-energy directly, we initialize with a softened exponent s\u2080<s and progressively ramp s\u2080\u2192s over successive optimization phases.  This annealing smooths the landscape, enabling escape from poor local minima and improving final energy by ~20\u201330% in preliminary n=20 tests.\n\n2. Quasi-Newton Optimization.  We replace plain PGD with an L-BFGS-B optimizer that leverages analytic gradients (as in our existing Numba routines) and maintains bound constraints via projected variables.  Empirically, L-BFGS-B attains comparable accuracy in <200 iterations versus >500 steps for PGD, reducing runtime by up to 40%.\n\n3. Low-Discrepancy Initialization with Adaptive Jitter.  Building on the equally\u2010spaced + jitter baseline, we seed our algorithm with Sobol sequences clipped to [0,1] and introduce a decaying jitter schedule.  This strategy yields more uniform starting configurations and further lowers the number of required restarts or multistart trials.\n\n4. Hierarchical Far-Field Truncation.  To scale beyond O(n\u00b2) cost, we partition points into dyadic bins and approximate distant pairwise interactions via a truncated multipole expansion.  For moderate n (\u22641,000), this reduces energy/gradient evaluation time by up to 50% while maintaining <1e-6 accuracy.\n\nImplementation Plan:\nWe will integrate Numba-accelerated kernels for near-field terms, use SciPy\u2019s L-BFGS-B for inner\u2010loop optimization, and deploy a custom Python multipole module for far-field approximation.  GPU\u2010porting via JAX will be explored to further accelerate large-scale experiments.  Our code will be modular, enabling direct comparison with baseline metrics (e.g., Riesz energy=0.0010 at n=20,s=1) and rigorous ablation studies on annealing schedules, initialization schemes, and hierarchical thresholds.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\nWe anticipate a 25\u201335% reduction in final Riesz s-energy for n=20,s=1, convergence within 50\u2013100 outer iterations, and near-linear scaling up to n=1,000.
