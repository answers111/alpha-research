We propose a fully implementable solver that addresses these limitations via four core innovations:\n\n1. Hypergradient-Driven Homotopy and Step-Size Control  \n   \u2013 We derive online hypergradients for both homotopy exponent increments \u0394s_i and per-iteration learning rates. By differentiating final energy w.r.t. homotopy schedule and step-size history, the solver dynamically adapts its continuation path and descent aggressiveness, reducing homotopy stages by >70% and preventing flat-land traps without manual tuning.\n\n2. Multi-Fidelity Energy and Hessian Hierarchies  \n   \u2013 We maintain three fidelities of pairwise interactions: (a) coarse O(n) far-field via truncated FMM expansions, (b) medium-fidelity via randomized Nystrom sketches of the Hessian, and (c) exact local sums for nearest neighbors. An error estimator governs fidelity switches, ensuring that expensive high-precision computations are invoked only when residuals exceed adaptive tolerances.\n\n3. Neural-Augmented Quasi-Newton Preconditioners  \n   \u2013 A lightweight graph neural operator (GNO) is trained on small-n prototypes to predict low-rank corrections to a block-diagonal quasi-Newton preconditioner. At runtime, we fuse these GNO predictions with an L-BFGS memory buffer, capturing both global curvature and local refinements in O(n log n) time, and restoring superlinear convergence in shallow regions.\n\n4. Asynchronous Overlapping Domain Decomposition  \n   \u2013 By partitioning [0,1] into overlapping subdomains processed on separate GPU streams and exchanging only boundary corrections when regional error bounds are violated, we overlap computation and communication. This design achieves near-linear scaling to n=10\u2074 on commodity multi-GPU clusters while bounding synchronization overhead to <5%.\n\nWe deliver a modular, open-source library (JAX + C++ FMM kernels + PyTorch GNO) with pip-installable components, automated hyperparameter tuning via HyperOpt, and Dockerized benchmarks.

Meta-Learned Homotopy and Step-Size Controllers  \n   \u2022 A lightweight reinforcement-learning agent observes local descent curvature and energy decrease to dynamically select both exponent increments (\u0394s_i) and per-iteration step sizes. By meta-training on small n instances, the agent accelerates convergence, reducing homotopy stages by 60% and averting stagnation above 10\u207b\u2078.\n\n2.

Asynchronous Domain-Decomposed Surrogate Correction  \n   \u2022 We partition [0,1] into overlapping subdomains computed on separate CUDA streams, exchanging boundary adjustments via nonblocking MPI. Within each subdomain, a shallow neural surrogate approximates far-field repulsion in O(n log n), triggering direct local Newton steps only when residuals exceed adaptive error bounds.

We propose a fully implementable solver that addresses these limitations via four core innovations:\n\n1. Hypergradient-Driven Homotopy and Step-Size Control  \n   \u2013 We derive online hypergradients for both homotopy exponent increments \u0394s_i and per-iteration learning rates. By differentiating final energy w.r.t. homotopy schedule and step-size history, the solver dynamically adapts its continuation path and descent aggressiveness, reducing homotopy stages by >70% and preventing flat-land traps without manual tuning.\n\n2. Multi-Fidelity Energy and Hessian Hierarchies  \n   \u2013 We maintain three fidelities of pairwise interactions: (a) coarse O(n) far-field via truncated FMM expansions, (b) medium-fidelity via randomized Nystrom sketches of the Hessian, and (c) exact local sums for nearest neighbors. An error estimator governs fidelity switches, ensuring that expensive high-precision computations are invoked only when residuals exceed adaptive tolerances.\n\n3. Neural-Augmented Quasi-Newton Preconditioners  \n   \u2013 A lightweight graph neural operator (GNO) is trained on small-n prototypes to predict low-rank corrections to a block-diagonal quasi-Newton preconditioner. At runtime, we fuse these GNO predictions with an L-BFGS memory buffer, capturing both global curvature and local refinements in O(n log n) time, and restoring superlinear convergence in shallow regions.\n\n4. Asynchronous Overlapping Domain Decomposition  \n   \u2013 By partitioning [0,1] into overlapping subdomains pr...(truncated)\n\n# Task\nSuggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.\n\nYou MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)\n=======\n# New replacement code\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExample of valid diff format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(p):\n        for k in range(n):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n=======\n# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern\nfor i in range(m):\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(p):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nYou can suggest multiple changes.
