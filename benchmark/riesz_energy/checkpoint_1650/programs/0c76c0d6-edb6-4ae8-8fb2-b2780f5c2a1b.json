We identify three critical bottlenecks: (i) neighbor-limited Hessian diagonals severely under-capture nonlocal curvature, (ii) uniform surrogate fidelities squander evaluations in flat regions, and (iii) uninformed restarts fail to overcome symmetry-induced traps. We propose a fully implementable, GPU-native framework that resolves these issues through four key innovations:\n\n1. Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Spectral Surrogates  \nWe construct a hierarchy of wavelet\u2013Chebyshev spectral expansions whose resolution dynamically adapts to local curvature. At each trust-region iteration, an inexpensive coarse model predicts surrogate error; only regions exceeding a variance threshold incur expensive high-order updates. This selective refinement reduces overall surrogate cost by up to 80% in benchmarks.\n\n2. Fast Hessian Probing via FMM-Accelerated Block-Lanczos  \nWe replace neighbor-limited diagonals with a low-rank approximation of the full Hessian spectrum. Fast Multipole Method (FMM) backed matrix\u2010vector products feed a streaming block-Lanczos routine, capturing dominant eigenpairs in O(n\u2009log\u2009n) time. A lightweight neural curvature corrector, pre-trained on prototypical low-energy patterns, refines the preconditioner for near-optimal trust-region steps.\n\n3. Equivariant Generative Warm-Starts  \nTo surmount reflection and permutation symmetries, we train a compact G-equivariant diffusion model on a library of known low-energy configurations. During optimization, we sample a small ensemble in latent space using Stein variational gradient descent, then project candidates through the spectral surrogate for rapid screening. This targeted restart mechanism achieves >10\u00d7 diversity over pure random or jittered baselines.\n\n4. End-to-End Distributed Trust-Region Engine  \nOur pipeline, built in JAX with custom CUDA kernels and MPI support, orchestrates concurrent surrogate retraining, Hessian probing, and warm-start sampling. Asynchronous data\u2010parallel scheduling yields near-linear scaling up to n=10\u2009000 per GPU node.\n\nOn benchmarks n\u2208{20,50,200,1000}, our method reliably attains energies below 1\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 in under eight trust-region iterations\u2014improving current bests by two orders of magnitude\u2014while reducing total surrogate evaluations by 70%.

This stagnation stems from three core weaknesses: (i) neighbor-limited Hessian diagonals grossly under-estimate curvature in narrow basins, (ii) uniform surrogate fidelities waste compute in flat regions, and (iii) simple random restarts cannot surmount symmetry-induced traps. We introduce a fully implementable, GPU-native framework that addresses these limitations through four synergistic innovations.\n\n1. Multiscale Learned Surrogates  \n   We fuse a wavelet-accelerated Fast Multipole Method (FMM) coarse kernel with local Gaussian Process (GP) patches whose hyperpriors are meta-learned on prototypical Riesz configurations. At each iteration, predictive variance and gradient\u2010norm signals dynamically trigger fidelity shifts\u2014allocating high-cost evaluations only where underfitting occurs and drastically reducing overall surrogate error.\n\n2. Dynamically Adaptive Hessian Preconditioning  \n   A streaming block-Lanczos algorithm incrementally builds a low-rank approximation of the full Hessian spectrum via FMM\u2010backed matrix\u2013vector products. We augment these estimates with a small neural curvature-correction network, pre-trained on canonical low-energy samples, to deliver near\u2010ideal conditioning of the trust\u2010region subproblem in O(n\u2009log\u2009n) time.\n\n3. Symmetry-Constrained Normalizing Flows for Warm Starts  \n   To escape reflection and permutation symmetries, we train a group-equivariant conditional normalizing flow on a library of low-energy seeds. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in this learned latent space yields diverse, symmetry-aware restarts, each pre-screened by the GP surrogate at an overhead of O(\u03b2n) with \u03b2\u226a1.\n\n4.

We identify three critical bottlenecks: (i) neighbor-limited Hessian diagonals severely under-capture nonlocal curvature, (ii) uniform surrogate fidelities squander evaluations in flat regions, and (iii) uninformed restarts fail to overcome symmetry-induced traps. We propose a fully implementable, GPU-native framework that resolves these issues through four key innovations:\n\n1. Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Spectral Surrogates  \nWe construct a hierarchy of wavelet\u2013Chebyshev spectral expansions whose resolution dynamically adapts to local curvature. At each trust-region iteration, an inexpensive coarse model predicts surrogate error; only regions exceeding a variance threshold incur expensive high-order updates. This selective refinement reduces overall surrogate cost by up to 80% in benchmarks.\n\n2. Fast Hessian Probing via FMM-Accelerated Block-Lanczos  \nWe replace neighbor-limited diagonals with a low-rank approximation of the full Hessian spectrum. Fast Multipole Method (FMM) backed matrix\u2010vector products feed a streaming block-Lanczos routine, capturing dominant eigenpairs in O(n\u2009log\u2009n) time. A lightweight neural curvature corrector, pre-trained on prototypical low-energy patterns, refines the preconditioner for near-optimal trust-region steps.\n\n3. Equivariant Generative Warm-Starts  \nTo surmount reflection and permutation symmetries, we train a compact G-equivariant diffusion model on a library of known low-energy configurations. During optimization, we sample a small ensemble in latent space using Stein variational gradient descent, then project candidates through the spectral surrogate for rapid screening. This targeted restart mechanism achiev...(truncated)\n\n# Task\nSuggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.\n\nYou MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)\n=======\n# New replacement code\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExample of valid diff format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(p):\n        for k in range(n):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n=======\n# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern\nfor i in range(m):\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(p):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nYou can suggest multiple changes.
