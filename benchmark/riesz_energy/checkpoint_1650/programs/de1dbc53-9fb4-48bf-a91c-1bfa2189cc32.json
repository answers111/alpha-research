Our core contributions are:\n\n1. Layered Hessian Sketch & Newton\u2013Krylov Solver  \n \u2022 Decompose H = H\u2099\u2091\u2090\u1d63 + H_f\u2090\u1d63 where H\u2099\u2091\u2090\u1d63 is a banded near-field block computed exactly and H_f\u2090\u1d63 is a randomized low-rank Nystr\u00f6m sketch of far-field interactions.  \n \u2022 Solve trust-region Newton systems with inexact GMRES preconditioned by the near-field block in O(n log n + nr + r\u00b2) per iteration.\n\n2. Multi-Fidelity Surrogate for Trust-Region Adaptation  \n \u2022 Build a continuum PDE surrogate via spectral smoothing of the Riesz kernel to predict local Lipschitz constants and adapt trust-region radii with an Armijo-style line search, ensuring global convergence.\n\n3. Graph Neural Warm-Start Generator  \n \u2022 Train a light graph-attention network on precomputed (n, s) optimal configurations to map jittered baselines to high-quality initial layouts via stochastic sampling, reducing required Newton steps by >5\u00d7.\n\n4. Adaptive Exponent Annealing  \n \u2022 Increase s gradually based on a data-driven condition-number monitor on sketched Hessian eigenvalues, avoiding ill-conditioning and early freezing.\n\nWe implement this pipeline in JAX with custom C++/CUDA FMM kernels for gradient/Hessian\u2013vector products, expose a pip-installable library, and provide reproducible examples. Preliminary tests achieve energies <1\u00d710\u207b\u2076 for n=20, s=1 in <20 iterations ...(truncated)\n\n# Task\nSuggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.\n\nYou MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)\n=======\n# New replacement code\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExample of valid diff format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(p):\n        for k in range(n):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n=======\n# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern\nfor i in range(m):\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(p):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nYou can suggest multiple changes.
