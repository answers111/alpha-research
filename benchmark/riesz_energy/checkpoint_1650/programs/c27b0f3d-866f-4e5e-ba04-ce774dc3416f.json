Move the sorting step into `optimize` so that you no longer need a separate `np.sort` in `main`.  \n3. Decorate `optimize` with `@njit` so the entire inner loop lives in Numba rather than Python.  \n4. Simplify the jittered baseline routine for readability.\n\nEach diff is shown in the required SEARCH/REPLACE format:\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n@njit(parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_energy(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> float:\n=======\n@njit(parallel=True, fastmath=True, cache=True)\ndef compute_energy(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> float:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n@njit(parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_grad(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> np.ndarray:\n=======\n@njit(parallel=True, fastmath=True, cache=True)\ndef compute_grad(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> np.ndarray:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef optimize(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0, lr: float = 1e-2, iters: int = 2000, tol: float = 1e-8, beta: float = 0.9) -> np.ndarray:\n=======\n@njit(fastmath=True, cache=True)\ndef optimize(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0, lr: float = 1e-2, iters: int = 2000, tol: float = 1e-8, beta: float = 0.9) -> np.ndarray:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef jittered_baseline(n: int, seed: int = 0, jitter: float = 1e-3) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Return equally spaced points with uniform jitter in [0,1]; boundaries fixed.\"\"\"\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n    xs = equally_spaced(n)\n    if jitter > 0 and n > 2:\n        # jitter only interior points to preserve fixed endpoints exactly at 0 and 1\n        xs_inner = xs[1:-1] + rng.uniform(-jitter, jitter, size=n - 2)\n        xs[1:-1] = np.clip(xs_inner, 0.0, 1.0)\n    return xs\n=======\ndef jittered_baseline(n: int, seed: int = 0, jitter: float = 1e-3) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Return equally spaced points with optional jitter in [0,1]; boundaries fixed.\"\"\"\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n    xs = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, n)\n    if jitter > 0 and n > 2:\n        noise = rng.uniform(-jitter, jitter, size=n - 2)\n        xs[1:-1] = np.clip(xs[1:-1] + noise, 0.0, 1.0)\n    return xs\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return xs\n=======\n    # ensure monotonic ordering for consistent energy evaluations\n    xs.sort()\n    return xs\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    xs_local = np.sort(xs_local)  # ensure global ordering after the Numba-compiled pass\n=======\n    # xs_local = np.sort(xs_local)  # sorted inside optimize\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nExplanation of benefits:\n\n- `cache=True`: avoids recompiling your Numba functions every run, speeding up iterative development and repeated calls.  \n- `@njit` on `optimize`: moves the heavy gradient\u2010descent loop into Numba, cutting Python overhead.  \n- Sorting inside `optimize`: ensures correct ordering before each energy call, so you can drop the extra sort in `main`.  \n- Simplified `jittered_baseline`: fewer lines, easier to read and maintain without changing behavior."]}}}
