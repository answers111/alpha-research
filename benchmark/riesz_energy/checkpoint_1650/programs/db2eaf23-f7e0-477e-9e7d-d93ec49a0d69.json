Transformer-Based Warm-Start Generator  \n \u2022 Pretrain a lightweight sequence Transformer on a library of (n, s) optimal configurations with positional encodings reflecting inter-point distances.  \n \u2022 Generate sub-micro-precision initial layouts by mapping jittered baselines through the Transformer, reducing Newton iterations by >10\u00d7 in preliminary tests.\n\n4. Spectral Exponent Annealing with Condition-Monitor  \n \u2022 Dynamically increase exponent s via a monitor on the smallest sketched Hessian eigenvalue gap, preventing ill-conditioning and premature energy freezing.  \n \u2022 Integrate re-orthonormalization steps when s...(truncated)\n\n# Task\nSuggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.\n\nYou MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)\n=======\n# New replacement code\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExample of valid diff format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(p):\n        for k in range(n):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n=======\n# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern\nfor i in range(m):\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(p):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nYou can suggest multiple changes.
