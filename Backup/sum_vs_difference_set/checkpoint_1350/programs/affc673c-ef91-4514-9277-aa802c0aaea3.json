We introduce AdaptiveRatioGEM, a fully automated framework that addresses these limitations via four novel contributions:\n\n1. Self-Supervised Continual Surrogate Adaptation  \n \u2022 We augment the hypergraph-equivariant surrogate with a contrastive pretraining objective: search states are paired as positive (low edit distance) and negative (high edit distance) examples, enabling continual representation refinement without labeled data.  \n \u2022 A lightweight \u201cproxy-teacher\u201d network flags distributional drift in surrogate predictions, triggering incremental retraining on buffered high-uncertainty states.\n\n2. Hierarchical Sequence-to-Sequence Planning  \n \u2022 We decompose the proposal policy into a two-stage Transformer: a high-level \u201cmacro-action\u201d generator that selects clusters of bits, and a low-level \u201cmicro-reconfigurer\u201d that applies targeted flips/swaps within each cluster.  \n \u2022 At runtime, an iterative deepening Monte Carlo Tree Search (ID-MCTS) uses the surrogate\u2019s uncertainty maps to allocate search depth dynamically, achieving longer look-aheads in promising subregions with minimal extra cost.\n\n3. Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Controller  \n \u2022 Building on contextual\u2010bandit ideas, we introduce a Bayesian Change-Point Detector that monitors the surrogate\u2019s calibration error in real time. When error exceeds a threshold, the controller shifts budget toward exact evaluations; otherwise, it exploits ...(truncated)\n\n# Previous Program:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.random import default_rng\nimport math\n\n# Prebind convolution and correlation functions for speed\nconvolve_fn = np.convolve\ncorrelate_fn = np.correlate\n\n# For reproducibility\nrng = default_rng(42)\nrng_random = rng.random\nexp = math.exp\ncnz = np.count_nonzero\n\n# Compute the sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio for two 0/1 indicator vectors\ndef compute_ratio(A_ind: np.ndarray, B_ind: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio |A+B|/|A\u2212B|.
