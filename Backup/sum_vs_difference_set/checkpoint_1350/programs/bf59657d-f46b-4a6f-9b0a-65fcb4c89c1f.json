Differentiable Graph Transformer Surrogate  \n \u2022 We model bit-interaction as a sparse graph and train a lightweight Graph Transformer via self-supervised contrastive pretraining to predict both ratio and epistemic uncertainty.  \n \u2022 Online meta-fine-tuning with only 100 exact evaluations per new bit-length achieves >85% uncertainty calibration, reducing full evaluations by 65% while retaining high-fidelity predictions.\n\n2. Hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search with Continuous Relaxation  \n \u2022 A two-level MCTS splits the search: the upper tree proposes bit-block partitions, the lower layer uses a differentiable continuous relaxation of bit flips, enabling gradient-guided rollouts.  \n \u2022 We integrate Stein variational gradient descent for policy adaptation, doubling the discovery rate of promising high-ratio regions per batch.\n\n3. Self-Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Bandit Scheduler  \n \u2022 We extend Thompson sampling into a contextual bandit that dynamically allocates budget among the surrogate, an FFT-based proxy, and exact evaluations based on predicted information gain.  \n \u2022 This scheduler reallocates compute in real time, cutting expensive calls by 75% without compromising final solution quality.\n\n4. Dynamic Spectral Partition Refinement  \n \u2022 Leveraging surrogate Hessians, we iteratively coarsen low-variance clusters and refine high-variance regions in the bit-interaction graph.  \n \u2022 This adaptive partitioning yields 60% fewer subproblems and preserves critical cross-cluster dependencies for near-optimal pattern discovery.\n\nWhen applied to benchmarks up to N=10 000, RatioNet achieves sum-to-difference ratios of 1.98\u20132.05\u20145\u201310% above existing methods\u2014while delivering a 20\u00d7 speedup in time-to-target.

We propose FlowOpt+, a unified framework that remedies these deficiencies through four synergistic innovations:\n\n1. Meta-Active Graph Surrogate  \n   \u2022 We replace on-the-fly convolutions with a lightweight Graph Neural Network (GNN) that predicts ratio and uncertainty on bit-interaction graphs.  \n   \u2022 An episodic meta-learner rapidly adapts the GNN to new bit-lengths using only 50 exact evaluations, achieving 90% uncertainty calibration and reducing full evaluations by 75%.\n\n2. Hierarchical Stein-GFlowNet Sampler  \n   \u2022 We embed our surrogate in a two-level GFlowNet: a coarse policy over bit-block partitions and a fine policy over individual flips, enabling structured global exploration.  \n   \u2022 Stein variational flows with control variates deliver low-variance gradient estimates through a continuous relaxation, doubling acceptance of high-ratio proposals in each batch.\n\n3. Multi-Fidelity Bandit Allocation  \n   \u2022 We introduce an asynchronous Thompson-sampling bandit that learns per-cluster fidelity returns, dynamically trading off among surrogate, FFT-proxy, and exact routines.  \n   \u2022 This scheduler concentrates compute where uncertainty and predicted gain are highest, cutting expensive calls by 70% without degrading final ratios.\n\n4. Dynamic Spectral Clustering of Bit Interactions  \n   \u2022 We use surrogate Hessians to construct evolving bit-interaction graphs and apply spectral coarsening to merge low-signal regions and split volatile clusters.  \n   \u2022 This adaptive decomposition yields 50% fewer subproblems and preserves cross-cluster dependencies critical to discovering near-optimal patterns...(truncated)\n\n# Previous Program:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.random import default_rng\nimport math\n\n# For reproducibility\nrng = default_rng(42)\n# Pre-bind for speed\nconvolve = np.convolve\ncount_nonzero = np.count_nonzero\nrng_random = rng.random\nrng_choice = rng.choice\n\n# Global cache for computed ratios\n_ratio_cache = {}\n\n# Compute the sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio for two 0/1 indicator vectors\ndef compute_ratio(A_ind: np.ndarray, B_ind: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio |A+B|/|A\u2212B|.

Self-Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Bandit Scheduler  \n \u2022 We extend Thompson sampling into a contextual bandit that dynamically allocates budget among the surrogate, an FFT-based proxy, and exact evaluations based on predicted information gain.  \n \u2022 This scheduler reallocates compute in real time, cutting expensive calls by 75% without compromising final solution quality.\n\n4. Dynamic Spectral Partition Refinement  \n \u2022 Leveraging surrogate Hessians, we iteratively coarsen low-variance clusters and refine high-variance regions in the bit-interaction graph.  \n \u2022 This adaptive partitioning yields 60% fewer subproblems and preserves critical cross-cluster dependencies ...(truncated)\n\n# Task\nSuggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.\n\nYou MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)\n=======\n# New replacement code\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExample of valid diff format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(p):\n        for k in range(n):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n=======\n# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern\nfor i in range(m):\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(p):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nYou can suggest multiple changes.
