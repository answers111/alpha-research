We propose NeuroOpt-SumDiff, a novel framework that addresses these weaknesses by unifying (1) a Graph-Attentive GFlowNet\u2013MCTS hybrid for global\u2013local policy learning, (2) hierarchical multi-fidelity surrogates for fast, uncertainty-aware evaluation, and (3) dynamic subspace partitioning via learned neural affinities.  \n\n1. Graph-Attentive GFlowNet\u2013MCTS Loop  \n \u2022 A GFlowNet policy, parameterized by a graph-attention network over indicator supports, generates diverse high-reward flip proposals.  \n \u2022 Those proposals seed Monte Carlo Tree Search expansions, where a light actor-critic value net refines candidate moves through local multi-bit flips.  \n \u2022 Backpropagated returns update both GFlowNet and MCTS value estimators, fostering an end-to-end learned search strategy that outperforms blind annealing.  \n\n2.
