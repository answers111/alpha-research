Inspired by recent successes in surrogate-assisted optimization, multi-agent co-evolution, and multi-fidelity scheduling, we propose a unified, implementable framework that achieves higher ratios with dramatically fewer exact computations:\n\n1.

We identify four critical bottlenecks: (1) local hill-climbing overfits to small perturbations and ignores global structure; (2) static annealing and fixed batch sizes fail to adapt to varying instance hardness; (3) absence of explicit diversity or novelty drives leads to premature convergence; (4) single-fidelity evaluations waste compute on low-potential candidates. To overcome these, we propose a unified, implementable framework combining symmetry-aware hypergraph surrogates, hierarchical multi-agent search, curriculum-guided multi-fidelity control, and diversity-preserving evolutionary refinement:\n\n1.

Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Evaluation  \n \u2022 Tier 1: O(N log N) spectral relaxations provide fast upper/lower bound estimates.  \n \u2022 Tier 2: LP relaxations on projected sum/difference sets yield tighter interval bounds.  \n \u2022 Tier 3: Surrogate ense...(truncated)\n\n# Task\nSuggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.\n\nYou MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)\n=======\n# New replacement code\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExample of valid diff format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(p):\n        for k in range(n):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n=======\n# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern\nfor i in range(m):\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(p):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nYou can suggest multiple changes.
