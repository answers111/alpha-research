Prebind and simplify the `compute_ratio` convolution by moving `np.convolve` to a module\u2010level name, switching from `.astype()` to `.view()` when possible, and fixing the typo from `B_ind` to `B_int`.\n\n2. In `main()`, prebind `rng.random`, `rng.choice`, `np.flatnonzero`, and `math.exp` to local variables before the loop, and then use those locals inside the hot loop.\n\nEach diff strictly follows the SEARCH/REPLACE format.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Compute the sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio for two 0/1 indicator vectors via set operations\ndef compute_ratio(A_ind: np.ndarray, B_ind: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio |A+B|/|A\u2212B| using set operations. \n    Return \u22121.0 if infeasible.\"\"\"\n    # quick infeasibility check\n    if not A_ind.any() or not B_ind.any():\n        return -1.0\n    # convert to small ints (avoids large Python\u2010side loops)\n    A_int = A_ind.astype(np.int8, copy=False)\n    B_int = B_ind.astype(np.int8, copy=False)\n    # convolution for sum\u2010set: nonzero bins = unique sums\n    conv_sum = np.convolve(A_int, B_int)\n    # convolution with reversed B for difference\u2010set (cross\u2010correlation)\n    conv_diff = np.convolve(A_int, B_ind[::-1])\n    num_sums = np.count_nonzero(conv_sum)\n    num_diffs = np.count_nonzero(conv_diff)\n    return (num_sums / num_diffs) if num_diffs > 0 else -1.0\n=======\n# Prebind convolution for performance\n_convolve = np.convolve\ndef compute_ratio(A_ind: np.ndarray, B_ind: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute sum-to-difference ratio |A+B|/|A\u2212B|.
