We propose MultiScale-GROM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that overcomes these limitations through four key innovations:\n\n1. Dynamic Graph Pooling and Refinement  \n \u2022 Learnable coarsening/unpooling modules adapt the granularity of the search graph on the fly, preserving global structure while exposing local refinement opportunities.  \n \u2022 This replaces fixed two-level hierarchies with a continuum of scales, enabling richer cross-scale coordination.\n\n2.

Hierarchical Meta-Critic Reinforcement Learning with MAML  \n \u2022 A three-tier actor-critic architecture: (i) a global meta-actor proposes supernode reassignments, (ii) a mid-level actor refines cluster allocations, and (iii) local critics evaluate micro-moves.  \n \u2022 We apply Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) across N={30,50,100} tasks to produce policies that generalize quickly to unseen sizes with minimal fine-tuning.\n\n4. Information-Theoretic Multi-Fidelity Scheduler  \n \u2022 An acquisition-function based on expected information gain decides between surrogate evaluation, partial SDP relaxations, or full ratio computation.  \n \u2022 This scheduler reduces expensive oracle calls by 90% while ensuring high-confidence improvements.\n\nImplementation & Results  \nMultiScale-GROM is implemented in P...(truncated)\n\n# Previous Program:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.random import default_rng\nimport math\n# Pre\u2010bind exponential for simulated\u2010annealing checks\nexp = math.exp\n\n# Cache for computed ratios to avoid redundant convolution calls\nratio_cache = {}\n\n# For reproducibility and performance\nrng = default_rng(42)\n# Pre-bind NumPy and RNG functions for faster access\n# Removed convolution & correlation prebind; using set-based computation in compute_ratio\nrng_random = rng.random\nrng_choice = rng.choice\nflat_nonzero = np.flatnonzero\n\n# Compute the sum\u2010to\u2010difference ratio for two 0/1 indicator vectors\n# Replace with set-based computation for clarity and speed\ndef compute_ratio(A_ind: np.ndarray, B_ind: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute sum-to-difference ratio |A+B|/|A\u2212B|.
