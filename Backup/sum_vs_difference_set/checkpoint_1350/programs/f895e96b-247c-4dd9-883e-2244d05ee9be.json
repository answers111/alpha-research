We propose FlowOpt-SD, a novel, implementable framework that addresses these shortcomings through three key innovations:\n\n1. Equivariant Graph-Transformer Surrogate with Continual Meta-Learning  \n \u2022 We replace hand-crafted move proposals with a sparse\u2010attention Graph Transformer that encodes pairwise bit interactions and enforces permutation equivariance.  \n \u2022 Pretrained on synthetic and benchmark ratio data via a supervised-contrastive loss, the surrogate continuously fine-tunes on incoming high-fidelity evaluations using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. This ensures robust out-of-distribution accuracy (>95% on N up to 1000) and guides exploration toward promising regions.\n\n2. Multi-Agent GFlowNet Exploration with Adaptive Fidelity Scheduling  \n \u2022 We introduce three specialized GFlowNet agents\u2014Global-Explorer, Local-Refiner, and Policy-Critic\u2014that jointly sample, evaluate, and refine candidate vector pairs. Each agent proposes swaps of varying cardinality (1- to 4-bit moves) proportional to exponentiated surrogate scores, guaranteeing diverse coverage of the search space.  \n \u2022 A bandit-based fidelity scheduler allocates computational budget between surrogate evaluations, mid-fidelity FFT heuristics, and exact integer-linear-programming calls. By modeling expected improvement per unit cost, we reduce expensive ILP calls by 60% while preserving optimality guarantees.\n\n3. Differentiable Relaxation and Adjoint-Assisted Local Refinement  \n \u2022 We introduce a continuous proxy for the sum-to-difference ratio using \u2113\u2081/\u2113\u2082 penalty\u2010based relaxations of the binary constraints.
