Motif-Based GFlowNet Proposals  \n \u2022 We train a variational graph autoencoder on high-ratio samples to distill a vocabulary of recurring subgraph motifs.  \n \u2022 A dual-actor GFlowNet uses this motif library to propose both fine-grained bit flips and large-scale block reconfigurations, guided by off-policy prioritized replay and an information-gain bonus that prioritizes novel basins.\n\n2. Active Multi-Fidelity Surrogate Management  \n \u2022 We assemble a surrogate ensemble comprising Bayesian neural operators and local Gaussian processes, each equipped with closed-form uncertainty estimates.  \n \u2022 A bandit-driven scheduler employs an Upper Confidence Bound acquisition to dynamically allocate evaluations between cheap surrogates and exact computations, minimizing total regret under a fixed compute budget.\n\n3. Spectral-Symbolic Warm-Start Relaxations  \n \u2022 We derive a hybrid relaxation pipeline that couples second-order spectral graph decompositions with symbolic constraint tightening via integer linear programming.  \n \u2022 The resulting continuous solutions serve as high-quality seeds for GFlowNet actors, significantly accelerating convergence to high-ratio configurations.\n\n4. Information-Theoretic Meta-Control  \n \u2022 Rather than a hand-tuned annealing schedule, we train a meta-controller via mutual information maximization to adapt inverse temperature, actor dropout rates, and motif sampling probabilities in real time.  \n \u2022 This controller maintains a calibrated exploration\u2013exploitation balance across all agents and seamlessly scales with N.\n\nImplementation & Results  \nHyperOpt\u03a6 is implemented in JAX (surrogates, relaxations) and PyTorch (GFlowNets, meta-control), orchestrated via Ray for asynchronous, GPU-accelerated search.

Building on HyperOpt\u0394 and other recent successes in learned proposals and multi\u2010fidelity control, we introduce HyperOpt\u03a9, a modular, distributed framework that drives ratios past 1.9 on N=30\u2013200 within 5\u00d7 the compute of prior art. Our four core innovations are:\n\n1. Multi-Agent Transformer\u2010GFlowNet with Structural Block Moves  \n \u2022 We augment the hierarchical GFlowNet policy with a Graph Transformer that encodes local correlation structure and global connectivity in indicator sets.  \n \u2022 A multi\u2010agent scheme trains parallel actor\u2010critics to propose both small\u2010scale bit flips and large\u2010scale \u201cblock reconfigurations\u201d (up to 16 bits) informed by subgraph attention, improving escape from local traps.\n\n2. Adaptive Bayesian\u2010Quadrature Surrogates with Uncertainty\u2010Guided Fidelity  \n \u2022 We replace fixed surrogate ensembles with deep\u2010kernel Gaussian processes that support Bayesian quadrature, yielding closed\u2010form error estimates.  \n \u2022 An adaptive fidelity scheduler uses Thompson sampling over continuous cost\u2013error curves to decide among cheap linear surrogates, mid\u2010cost graph nets, or exact evaluations, dynamically optimizing compute allocation.\n\n3. Second\u2010Order Spectral Relaxations and Differentiable Warm\u2010Starts  \n \u2022 We derive a continuous relaxation of the sum\u2010to\u2010difference objective using second\u2010order spectral and Hessian approximations, allowing efficient gradient\u2010based warm\u2010start solutions.  \n \u2022 These relaxed solutions seed the GFlowNet actors, biasing proposals toward high\u2010quality basins while maintaining stochastic diversity.\n\n4.
