Key changes:\n\n- Increase `BATCH_SIZE` & `MAX_ITER` so more proposals and longer runs  \n- Slow cooling rate to allow extended exploration  \n- Add occasional random restarts from the global best to escape deep local minima  \n- Enhance `propose_move` with occasional 3-bit swaps and better jump probabilities  \n- Allow simultaneous moves in both vectors in the inner loop  \n\nPlease apply each diff exactly as shown.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nBATCH_SIZE = 10          # proposals per iteration\n=======\nBATCH_SIZE = 20          # proposals per iteration (increased for broader exploration)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nMAX_ITER = 20000         # local search iterations\n=======\nMAX_ITER = 50000         # local search iterations (increased for deeper search)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nCOOLING_DECAY = 0.995    # faster cooling to encourage exploitation\n=======\nCOOLING_DECAY = 0.998    # slower cooling for extended exploration\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for _ in range(MAX_ITER):\n=======\n    for it in range(MAX_ITER):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        T *= COOLING_DECAY\n=======\n        T *= COOLING_DECAY\n        # occasional random restart to escape stagnation\n        if it % 10000 == 0 and rand() < 0.05:\n            current_A, current_B, current_ratio = best_A.copy(), best_B.copy(), best_ratio\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if ones.size and zeros.size:\n        # with small probability do a two-bit swap for larger jumps\n        if rng.random() < 0.2 and ones.size > 1 and zeros.size > 1:\n            removes = rng.choice(ones, size=2, replace=False)\n            adds = rng.choice(zeros, size=2, replace=False)\n            ind[removes] = False\n            ind[adds] = True\n        else:\n            i_remove = rng.choice(ones)\n            i_add = rng.choice(zeros)\n            ind[i_remove] = False\n            ind[i_add] = True\n=======\n    if ones.size and zeros.size:\n        p = rng.random()\n        # encourage larger jumps (3-bit swaps)\n        if p < 0.1 and ones.size > 2 and zeros.size > 2:\n            removes = rng.choice(ones, size=3, replace=False)\n            adds = rng.choice(zeros, size=3, replace=False)\n            ind[removes] = False\n            ind[adds] = True\n        # medium jumps (2-bit swaps)\n        elif p < 0.4 and ones.size > 1 and zeros.size > 1:\n            removes = rng.choice(ones, size=2, replace=False)\n            adds = rng.choice(zeros, size=2, replace=False)\n            ind[removes] = False\n            ind[adds] = True\n        # standard single-bit move\n        else:\n            i_remove = rng.choice(ones)\n            i_add = rng.choice(zeros)\n            ind[i_remove] = False\n            ind[i_add] = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if rng.random() < 0.5:\n                C_ind = propose_move(C_ind)\n            else:\n                D_ind = propose_move(D_ind)\n=======\n            r = rng.random()\n            if r < 0.4:\n                C_ind = propose_move(C_ind)\n            elif r < 0.8:\n                D_ind = propose_move(D_ind)\n            else:\n                # simultaneous small moves in both\n                C_ind = propose_move(C_ind)\n                D_ind = propose_move(D_ind)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
