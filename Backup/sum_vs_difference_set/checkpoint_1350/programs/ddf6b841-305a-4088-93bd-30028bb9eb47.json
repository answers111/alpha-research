Cross-Entropy Meta-Search with Acquisition-Driven Sampling  \n \u2022 Maintains a population of candidate pairs, updating a parameterized Boltzmann distribution over generative moves.  \n \u2022 Uses expected improvement and upper-confidence bound acquisition functions to balance exploration and exploitation.  \n\n4.
