Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["Below are three targeted diffs to introduce plateau\u2010based restarts, slow down the annealing schedule for better exploration, and diversify the `propose_move` swaps. These changes should help escape local plateaus and boost the final ratio on average without rewriting the entire program.\n\n1) Initialize a plateau counter and use a slower cooling rate:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    max_iter = 50000  # deeper search budget\n    current_A, current_B = best_A.copy(), best_B.copy()\n    current_ratio = best_ratio\n    T, alpha = 1.0, 0.9999  # initial temperature and decay\n=======\n    max_iter = 50000  # deeper search budget\n    plateau_count = 0\n    plateau_limit = 5000  # restart if stuck this many non-improving steps\n    current_A, current_B = best_A.copy(), best_B.copy()\n    current_ratio = best_ratio\n    T, alpha = 1.0, 0.9995  # slower decay to allow more exploration\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n2) In the main Metropolis loop, reset on plateau and restart from the best known solution with small perturbations:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Metropolis acceptance\n        if ratio >= current_ratio or rng.random() < np.exp(delta / T):\n            current_A, current_B = C_ind, D_ind\n            current_ratio = ratio\n            # track global best\n            if ratio > best_ratio:\n                best_ratio, best_A, best_B = ratio, C_ind.copy(), D_ind.copy()\n        # cool down\n        T *= alpha\n=======\n        # Metropolis acceptance\n        if ratio >= current_ratio or rng.random() < np.exp(delta / T):\n            current_A, current_B = C_ind, D_ind\n            current_ratio = ratio\n            # track global best\n            if ratio > best_ratio:\n                best_ratio, best_A, best_B = ratio, C_ind.copy(), D_ind.copy()\n                plateau_count = 0  # reset on improvement\n        else:\n            plateau_count += 1  # increment on non-improvement\n\n        # if stuck on plateau, restart from best solution with slight perturbation\n        if plateau_count >= plateau_limit:\n            plateau_count = 0\n            current_A, current_B = best_A.copy(), best_B.copy()\n            for _ in range(3):\n                current_B = propose_move(current_B)\n            current_ratio = compute_ratio(current_A, current_B)\n\n        # cool down\n        T *= alpha\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n3) Make `propose_move` more exploratory by occasionally doing two or three swaps instead of always one or two:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    swaps = 2 if rng.random() < 0.2 else 1\n=======\n    # adaptively choose 1\u20133 swaps to improve exploration\n    r = rng.random()\n    if r < 0.15:\n        swaps = 3\n    elif r < 0.5:\n        swaps = 2\n    else:\n        swaps = 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation of changes:\n\n- **Plateau restarts**: We track how many consecutive steps fail to improve and, upon hitting `plateau_limit`, we restart the chain from the current best solution with a few random bit\u2010flips. This helps break out of long flat regions.\n- **Slower cooling**: Lowering `alpha` from `0.9999` to `0.9995` keeps the temperature higher for longer, giving the algorithm a better chance to jump over barriers.\n- **More diverse proposals**: Allowing up to three swaps with some probability helps the sampler make larger jumps when needed.\n\nThese targeted changes should increase the average best\u2010ratio found without dramatically complicating the code."]}}}
