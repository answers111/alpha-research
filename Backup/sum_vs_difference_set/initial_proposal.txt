Sum vs difference set on {0,…,N−1}: optimize |A+B| / |A−B|

Problem definition. Given two subsets A,B ⊆ {0,…,N−1}, define the sumset and diffset
S = {a+b : a∈A, b∈B},  D = {a−b : a∈A, b∈B}.
We study the ratio R(A,B) = |S| / |D|.

Constraints. Finite ground set {0,…,N−1}; indicator vectors are 0/1; invalid when A or B is empty, or |D|=0.

Optimization goal. In this benchmark we target R(A,B) close to 1. The evaluator returns a higher-is-better score defined as score = 1 / (1 + |R − 1|) if valid, else −1.

Best-known results. Classical “MSTD” (more sums than differences) sets exist even with A=B (e.g., Conway’s example). For small N, handcrafted or searched sets achieve R>1; for larger N, structured constructions and heuristic search continue to produce sum-dominant examples. Difference-dominant pairs also exist via symmetric/clustered designs.

Algorithm goal. Create algorithms that search for A,B with extreme R. This baseline returns an MSTD-style choice (A=B with a known example) as a starting point; more advanced search (greedy, swaps, simulated annealing, or SAT/MIP encodings) can further improve R under the same constraints.
