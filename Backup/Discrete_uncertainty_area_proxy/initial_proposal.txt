Discrete uncertainty area proxy

Problem definition. For a vector \(x \in \mathbb{C}^N\) and threshold \(\tau > 0\), define the active fraction
$$
A_{\tau}(x) = \frac{1}{N}\#\{k : |x_k| > \tau\},\qquad \widehat x = \text{DFT}(x).
$$
The proxy objective is
$$
\mathrm{product}_{\tau}(x) = A_{\tau}(x)\, A_{\alpha\tau}(\widehat x),\quad \text{with } \alpha = N \text{ for NumPy FFT}.
$$
We aim to minimize this product.

Constraints. Finite-length complex (or real) vector \(x\) of length \(N\); threshold \(\tau>0\). In implementation, we compute the unscaled forward FFT and use \(\alpha=N\) to align magnitude thresholds.

Optimization goal. Minimize \(\mathrm{product}_{\tau}(x)\). Smaller is better.

Best-known results (benchmark at \(\tau=0\)). The discrete uncertainty principle (Donoho–Stark) implies
$$
|\operatorname{supp}(x)|\,|\operatorname{supp}(\widehat x)| \ge N \;\Rightarrow\; \boxed{\mathrm{product}_0(x) \ge 1/N},
$$
which is tight for special \(N\) (e.g., Dirac combs).

Algorithm goal. Create an algorithm that searches for vectors with progressively smaller \(\mathrm{product}_{\tau}\). This baseline constructs simple structured candidates (e.g., Dirac comb) and evaluates the proxy via FFT; it serves as a starting point for more advanced search/optimization.
