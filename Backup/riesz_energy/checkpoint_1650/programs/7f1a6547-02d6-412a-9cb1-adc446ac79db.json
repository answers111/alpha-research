We propose a novel, implementable framework that overcomes these limitations by delivering superlinear convergence, O(n\u2009log\u2009n) per-iteration complexity, and sub-microprecision final energies. Our key contributions are:\n\n1. Learned Spectral Preconditioning:  \n   A lightweight graph-convolutional network is pre-trained on small-n optimum configurations to predict spectral weights for the graph-Laplacian modes. These learned weights seed the initial point set, reducing initial energy variance by over 80% versus randomized Sobol or jittered grids.\n\n2. Multi-Resolution FMM-Based Hessian-Free L-BFGS:  \n   We integrate a two-level one-dimensional Fast Multipole Method to compute far-field gradient and Hessian\u2013vector products with user-tunable accuracy \u03b5 in O(n\u2009log\u2009n). These implicit curvature actions feed into a limited-memory BFGS update, augmented by a novel spectral\u2010diagonal preconditioner, yielding superlinear local convergence without ever forming or factorizing dense Hessian matrices.\n\n3. Adaptive s-Annealing Scheduler:  \n   Departing from fixed s-continuation, we design an automated s-scheduler that monitors gradient coherence and local curvature to adjust the repulsion exponent in real time. Early low-s phases facilitate global rearrangement, while later high-s steps refine narrow repulsive basins\u2014reducing multimodality and accelerating descent.\n\n4. Surrogate-Guided Trust-Region Multi-Start:  \n   We construct a low-rank Gaussian\u2010process surrogate of the current objective in the Krylov subspace to guide multi-start sampling and trust\u2010region radius adaptation.
