Analysis of current hierarchical trust-region methods reveals three key limitations: (1) static fidelity thresholds in surrogate levels that misallocate computational effort, (2) Hessian-diagonal or fixed block-Lanczos preconditioners that inadequately capture rapidly changing curvature spectra, and (3) learned flow-based warm-starts that lack on-the-fly adaptation to newly discovered energy basins. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose:\n\n1. Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Surrogate Tower  \n   \u2022 Replace fixed-scale fidelity schedules with an error-guided controller that dynamically allocates work across (i) a global Chebyshev kernel approximation, (ii) mid-range RBF surrogates, and (iii) local high-order Taylor expansions.  \n   \u2022 Use posterior error estimates derived from adjoint sensitivity analysis to trigger level transitions, ensuring coarse models are exploited until their estimated model bias exceeds a prescribed threshold.\n\n2. Online Randomized Quasi-Newton Curvature Updates  \n   \u2022 Integrate a streaming Sketched L-BFGS routine that maintains a low-rank approximation of the full Hessian via randomized Hessian-vector products (O(n log n) per update with Fast Multipole acceleration).  \n   \u2022 Automatically adjust the sketch size based on spectrum decay, measured through cheap probing vectors, to guarantee a bounded trust-region subproblem condition number.\n\n3. Dynamic Graph Transformer Warm-Start Ensemble  \n   \u2022 Upgrade the conditional normalizing flow to a graph transformer that refines node embeddings during the optimization run, using feedback from recent trust-region trajectories.  \n   \u2022 Employ a multi-armed bandit strategy to sample diverse warm-start candidates, evaluated cheaply on the lowest-fidelity surrogate and reweighted by their out-of-sample energy reduction potential.\n\n4. Implementable High-Performance Backend  \n   \u2022 Develop a JAX/XLA pipeline with custom CUDA kernels for surrogate evaluation, randomized sketch updates, and asynchronous graph transformer inference.  \n   \u2022 Provide a modular Python library with Dockerized examples, pretrained graph-transformer checkpoints, and standard benchmarks for n up to 500 and s in [0.5, 2].\n\nPreliminary experiments demonstrate that, for n={20,50,200}, s=1.0, our method reaches final energies <1\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 within 8 trust-region iterations and wall-clock times 5\u201320\u00d7 faster than leading alternatives.

Our key contributions are:\n\n1. Hierarchical Multi\u2010Scale Surrogate Trust\u2010Regions  \n   \u2022 Build a three-level surrogate hierarchy: (i) a global Chebyshev spectral approximation for the long\u2010range kernel, (ii) an intermediate compact RBF model capturing medium\u2010scale interactions, and (iii) local quadratic patches in high-curvature intervals.  \n   \u2022 Schedule trust\u2010region solves across these levels by a fidelity-error criterion, enabling rapid basin escape on coarse scales and guaranteed high-precision refinement on the fine scale.  \n\n2. Randomized Block-Lanczos Curvature Subspaces  \n   \u2022 Replace static Hessian\u2010diagonal preconditioning with a streaming block\u2010Lanczos routine that adaptively builds a k-dimensional curvature subspace (k\u226an) in O(nk + k\u00b2) per update.  \n   \u2022 Solve the trust\u2010region subproblem in this subspace via a preconditioned truncated conjugate\u2010gradient, with automated trust\u2010region radius control informed by Lanczos-estimated eigenvalue bounds.  \n\n3. Graph-Enhanced Flow-Based Warm-Starts  \n   \u2022 Represent initial point sets as weighted 1D graphs and train a conditional graph normalizing flow to map (n,s,neighbor graphs) \u2192 low\u2010energy configurations.  \n   \u2022 Inject structured noise in the latent graph embedding to generate a diversified warm-start ensemble, prescreen via the hierarchical coarse surrogate (O(M...(truncated)\n\n# Previous Program:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numba import njit, prange\n\ndef equally_spaced(n: int) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Return n equally spaced points on [0,1].\"\"\"\n    # numpy.linspace handles n=0 and n=1 gracefully and is simpler to maintain\n    return np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, n)\n\ndef jittered_baseline(n: int, seed: int = 0, jitter: float = 1e-3):\n    \"\"\"A simple baseline: equal grid + tiny jitter (still clipped to [0,1]).\"\"\"\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n    xs = equally_spaced(n)\n    if n > 1:\n        xs += rng.uniform(-jitter, jitter, size=n)\n        xs = np.clip(xs, 0.0, 1.0)\n# Removed per-iteration sorting to save O(n log n) work\n    # (we only need the final ordering at the end)\n    xs.sort()\n    return xs\n\ndef chebyshev_nodes(n: int) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Return n Chebyshev nodes scaled to [0,1], clustering at endpoints.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return np.array([])\n    if n == 1:\n        return np.array([0.5])\n    k = np.arange(n)\n    xs = 0.5 * (1 -

Analysis of current hierarchical trust-region methods reveals three key limitations: (1) static fidelity thresholds in surrogate levels that misallocate computational effort, (2) Hessian-diagonal or fixed block-Lanczos preconditioners that inadequately capture rapidly changing curvature spectra, and (3) learned flow-based warm-starts that lack on-the-fly adaptation to newly discovered energy basins. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose:\n\n1. Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Surrogate Tower  \n   \u2022 Replace fixed-scale fidelity schedules with an error-guided controller that dynamically allocates work across (i) a global Chebyshev kernel approximation, (ii) mid-range RBF surrogates, and (iii) local high-order Taylor expansions.  \n   \u2022 Use posterior error estimates derived from adjoint sensitivity analysis to trigger level transitions, ensuring coarse models are exploited until their estimated model bias exceeds a prescribed threshold.\n\n2. Online Randomized Quasi-Newton Curvature Updates  \n   \u2022 Integrate a streaming Sketched L-BFGS routine that maintains a low-rank approximation of the full Hessian via randomized Hessian-vector products (O(n log n) per update with Fast Multipole acceleration).  \n   \u2022 Automatically adjust the sketch size based on spectrum decay, measured through cheap probing vectors, to guarantee a bounded trust-region subproblem condition number.\n\n3. Dynamic Graph Transformer Warm-Start Ensemble  \n   \u2022 Upgrade the conditional normalizing flow to a graph transformer that refines node embeddings during the optimization run, using feedback from recent trust-region trajectories.  \n   \u2022 Employ a multi-armed bandit strategy to sample diverse warm-st...(truncated)\n\n# Task\nSuggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.\n\nYou MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)\n=======\n# New replacement code\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExample of valid diff format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(p):\n        for k in range(n):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n=======\n# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern\nfor i in range(m):\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(p):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nYou can suggest multiple changes.

This should help the optimizer hop out of shallow traps and drive down the final energy."]}}}
