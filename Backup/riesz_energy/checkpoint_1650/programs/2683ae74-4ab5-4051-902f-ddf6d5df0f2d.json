We propose a unified, implementable framework that simultaneously drives final energies below 1\u00d710\u207b\u2075 and attains near-linear scaling up to n=10\u2075 through four synergistic innovations:\n\n1. Multi-Resolution Surrogate Initialization  \n   \u2013 Construct a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of spline-based surrogates fitted to low-cost FMM pilot runs. By solving a small-scale Riesz problem on each level, we generate warm starts that capture both global spacing patterns and local packing corrections, cutting initial energy variance by >80%.\n\n2. FMM-Preconditioned Truncated-Newton  \n   \u2013 Extend our 1D FMM to compute not only fast energy and gradient approximations but also low-rank Hessian sketching. Using randomized Lanczos on FMM Hessian-vector products, we assemble a block preconditioner for inexact Newton updates. This delivers superlinear convergence without ever forming dense Hessians and reduces per-iteration cost to O(n log n).\n\n3. Variance-Reduced Stochastic Gradient Corrections  \n   \u2013 In early iterations, we subsample O(n) interaction lists from the FMM tree with control variates derived from low-rank surrogates. This variance-reduced gradient estimator escapes shallow minima at O(n log n) cost per pass and smoothly transitions to the full FMM-Newton regime as the solution sharpens.\n\n4. Adaptive Log-Barrier and Temperature Control  \n   \u2013 Bound constraints are enforced via a self-tuning differentiable log-barrier whose weight decays proportionally to the local constraint residual. Simultaneously, a temperature schedule derived from spectral gap estimates injects vanishing noise, promoting basin exploration and eliminating ad-hoc momentum tuning.\n\nImplementation in JA...(truncated)\n\n# Previous Program:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numba import njit, prange\n\ndef equally_spaced(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Human-best configuration on [0,1] for any s>0.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return np.array([0.5])[:n]\n    return np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, n)\n\ndef jittered_baseline(n: int, seed: int = 0, jitter: float = 1e-3):\n    \"\"\"A simple baseline: equal grid + tiny jitter (still clipped to [0,1]).\"\"\"\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n    xs = equally_spaced(n)\n    if n > 1:\n        xs += rng.uniform(-jitter, jitter, size=n)\n        xs = np.clip(xs, 0.0, 1.0)\n# Removed per-iteration sorting to save O(n log n) work\n    # (we only need the final ordering at the end)\n    xs.sort()\n    return xs\n\n@njit(parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_energy(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute Riesz s-energy via direct double loop (numba accelerated).\"\"\"\n    n = xs.size\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0.0\n    ene = 0.0\n    for i in prange(n):\n        # Only sum j>i to avoid double counting\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            dx = abs(xs[i] - xs[j])\n            ene += dx ** (-s)\n    return ene\n\n@njit(parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_grad(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Compute gradient of Riesz s-energy via explicit loops (numba accelerated).\"\"\"\n    n = xs.size\n    grad = np.zeros(n)\n    if n < 2:\n        return grad\n    for i in prange(n):\n        g = 0.0\n        xi = xs[i]\n        # exploit sorted xs: split j<i and j>i to avoid abs()/sign() and branches\n        for j in range(i):\n            dx = xi - xs[j]    # always positive\n            g -= s * (dx ** (-s - 1))\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            dx = xs[j] - xi    # always positive\n            g += s * (dx ** (-s - 1))\n        grad[i] = g\n    return grad\n\n# New optimize with Nesterov momentum and adaptive backtracking\ndef optimize(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0, lr: float = 1e-2, iters: int = 2000, tol: float = 1e-8, momentum: float = 0.9) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent with backtracking line search and adaptive momentum decay.\"\"\"\n    xs = xs.copy()\n    xs_prev = xs.copy()\n    prev_energy = compute_energy(xs, s)\n    for k in range(1, iters + 1):\n        # Nesterov momentum extrapolation\n        y = xs + momentum * (xs - xs_prev)\n        # compute gradient at extrapolated point\n        g = compute_grad(y, s)\n        grad_norm_sq = np.dot(g, g)\n        if grad_norm_sq < tol * tol:\n            break\n        step = lr\n        # backtracking to ensure energy decreases\n        for _ in range(8):\n            xs_new = np.clip(y - step * g, 0.0, 1.0)\n            new_energy = compute_energy(xs_new, s)\n            if new_energy < prev_energy:\n                xs_prev = xs\n                xs = xs_new\n                prev_energy = new_energy\n                break\n            step *= 0.5\n        else:\n            # no decrease found: reduce momentum and learning rate, then retry\n            momentum *= 0.5\n            lr *= 0.5\n            continue\n        # gentle decay of learning rate\n        lr *= 0.995\n    xs.sort()\n    return xs\n\ndef main():\n    n = 20\n    s = 1.0\n    # initialize with equally spaced points\n    xs_init = jittered_baseline(n, seed=0, jitter=1e-3)\n    # refine via projected gradient descent\n    xs_local = optimize(xs_init, s, lr=1e-2, iters=500, momentum=0.9)\n    # report final energy\n    print(\"Final Riesz s-energy:\", compute_energy(xs_local, s))\n    return xs_local\n\n```\n\n# Previous Performance Metrics: \n- 1 / riesz_energy_n20_s1: 0.0010\n\n# Areas Identified for Improvement: \n- Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\n\n\n\n# Program Evolution History\n## Previous Attempts\n\n### Attempt 3\n- Changes: Unknown changes\n- Performance: 1 / riesz_energy_n20_s1: 0.0010\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n\n### Attempt 2\n- Changes: Unknown changes\n- Performance: 1 / riesz_energy_n20_s1: 0.0010\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Unknown changes\n- Performance: 1 / riesz_energy_n20_s1: 0.0010\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.0010)\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef equally_spaced(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return n equally spaced points on [0,1].\"\"\"\n    # np.linspace handles n=0 (empty) and n=1 ([0.0]) gracefully.\n    return np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, n)[:n]\n\ndef jittered_baseline(n: int, seed: int = 0, jitter: float = 1e-3):\n    \"\"\"A simple baseline: equal grid + tiny jitter (still clipped to [0,1]).\"\"\"\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n# ...

Restructure the line\u2010search/backtracking into a simple `while`\u2010loop with a flag, which is both easier to read and compatible with Numba.\n\nHere are the precise diffs\u2014each `SEARCH` block matches the current code exactly, and the `REPLACE` block shows the new replacement:\n\n```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef equally_spaced(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Human-best configuration on [0,1] for any s>0.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return np.array([0.5])[:n]\n    return np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, n)\n=======\ndef equally_spaced(n: int) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Return n equally spaced points on [0,1].\"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return np.empty(0)\n    if n == 1:\n        return np.array([0.5])\n    return np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, n)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef optimize(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0, lr: float = 1e-2, iters: int = 2000, tol: float = 1e-8, momentum: float = 0.9) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent with backtracking line search and adaptive momentum decay.\"\"\"\n=======\n@njit(parallel=False, fastmath=True)\ndef optimize(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0, lr: float = 1e-2, iters: int = 2000, tol: float = 1e-8, momentum: float = 0.9) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent with backtracking line search and adaptive momentum decay.\"\"\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        for _ in range(8):\n            xs_new = np.clip(y - step * g, 0.0, 1.0)\n            new_energy = compute_energy(xs_new, s)\n            if new_energy < prev_energy:\n                xs_prev = xs\n                xs = xs_new\n                prev_energy = new_energy\n                break\n            step *= 0.5\n        else:\n            # no decrease found: reduce momentum and learning rate, then retry\n            momentum *= 0.5\n            lr *= 0.5\n            continue\n=======\n        # rewritten backtracking to avoid for-else, for Numba compatibility\n        found = False\n        trial = 0\n        while trial < 8:\n            xs_new = np.clip(y - step * g, 0.0, 1.0)\n            new_energy = compute_energy(xs_new, s)\n            if new_energy < prev_energy:\n                xs_prev = xs\n                xs = xs_new\n                prev_energy = new_energy\n                found = True\n                break\n            step *= 0.5\n            trial += 1\n        if not found:\n            # no decrease found: reduce momentum and learning rate, then retry\n            momentum *= 0.5\n            lr *= 0.5\n            continue\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nExplanation of benefits:\n\n- By handling trivial cases in `equally_spaced` explicitly, we avoid slicing hacks and clarify behavior for n=0 or n=1.\n- Decorating `optimize` with `@njit` drastically cuts Python\u2010level overhead in the inner training loop, which becomes significant once n grows.\n- Removing the `for\u2013else` pattern and using a simple `while` + flag makes the backtracking logic both more readable and compatible with Numba\u2019s nopython mode."]}}}
