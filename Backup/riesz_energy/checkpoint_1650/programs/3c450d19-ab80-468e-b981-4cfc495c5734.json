We propose a novel, fully implementable framework that addresses these limitations and delivers sub-micro-precision solutions in subquadratic time:\n\n1. Multi-Level Hessian Approximation  \n   \u2022 Decompose the Hessian into a sparse, banded near-field block (computed exactly) and a randomized low-rank far-field sketch (via a hybrid Nystr\u00f6m\u2013FMM), enabling Hessian\u2013vector products and preconditioning in O(n log n + nr + r\u00b2) per iteration.  \n\n2. Spectral Trust-Region Surrogate  \n   \u2022 Construct a continuum PDE surrogate of the Riesz kernel through spectral filtering to estimate local Lipschitz and curvature constants.  \n   \u2022 Adapt trust-region radii with an Armijo-style criterion, ensuring robust global convergence and automatic step-size control.  \n\n3. Graph-Neural Warm-Start Synthesis  \n   \u2022 Embed jittered equally-spaced configurations into a spectral graph representation and train a lightweight attention-based GNN to predict near-optimal initial layouts, reducing Newton-Krylov iterations by over 5\u00d7.  \n\n4. Condition-Driven Exponent Annealing  \n   \u2022 Monitor the eigenvalue spread of the sketched Hessian to drive a dynamic schedule for the Riesz exponent s, mitigating ill-conditioning and preventing early stagnation.  \n\nImplemented in JAX with custom C++/CUDA FMM kernels and released as a pip-installable library, our method achieves energies below 1\u00d710\u207b\u2078 for n=50, s=1 in under 30 Newton\u2013Krylov steps\u2014realizing over an order-of-magnitude improvement in both precision and runtime compared to L-BFGS and conventional Newton methods\u2014thereby establishing a new benchmark fo...(truncated)\n\n# Task\nSuggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.\n\nYou MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)\n=======\n# New replacement code\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExample of valid diff format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(p):\n        for k in range(n):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n=======\n# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern\nfor i in range(m):\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(p):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nYou can suggest multiple changes.
