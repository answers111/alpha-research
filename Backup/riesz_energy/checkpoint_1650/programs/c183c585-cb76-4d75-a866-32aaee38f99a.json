We propose a fully automated, hyperparameter-free framework that (i) reduces per-iteration cost to O(n log n), (ii) drives residuals below 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 in under ten iterations for n up to 10\u2076, and (iii) eliminates manual tuning via adaptive trust-region globalization. Our key innovations are:\n\n1. Hierarchical Multi-Fidelity Decomposition  \n   \u2022 We layer a coarse-grid, piecewise-polynomial surrogate of point distributions with a fine-scale one-dimensional FMM. A dynamic fidelity controller automatically balances approximation error against computational budget, invoking fine FMM only where the coarse surrogate exceeds an \u03b5 threshold.\n\n2. Neural-Operator-Accelerated Preconditioner  \n   \u2022 An online-trained neural operator learns the global Hessian inverse on clustered subdomains using random-feature sketches. Combined with a block-diagonal plus low-rank SR1 update, it yields a mesh-refinement-aware preconditioner that captures both global and local curvature.\n\n3. Dynamic Trust-Region with Curvature-AWARE Radius Selection  \n   \u2022 We replace backtracking with an inexact projected dogleg method that computes trial steps by an inexact CG solve using FMM Hessian-vector products. A curvature-based rule adjusts the trust radius, avoiding costly finite-difference Lipschitz estimates while guaranteeing robust descent.\n\n4. Spectral-Homotopy Initialization  \n   \u2022 We warm-start the solver by projecting equally spaced points onto the first k Fourier modes of the Riesz kernel and then smoothly morph both the repulsion exponent s and Fourier cutoff using a two-parameter homotopy. This yields an O(n\u207b\u2074) initial energy gap.\n\n5.

This removes a huge number of generic `pow` operations.\n\n2. **Enable Numba\u2019s caching**  \n   By adding `cache=True` to both `@njit` decorators, we avoid repeated recompilation overhead across runs.\n\nBoth changes should cut down on inner\u2010loop arithmetic and start\u2010up time, improving the `riesz_energy_n20_s1` metric noticeably without altering the outer logic.\n\nHere are the exact diffs in the required SEARCH/REPLACE format:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n@njit(parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_energy(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> float:\n=======\n@njit(cache=True, parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_energy(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> float:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nand\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n@njit(parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_grad(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Compute gradient of Riesz s-energy via explicit loops (numba accelerated).\"\"\"\n    n = xs.size\n    grad = np.zeros(n)\n    if n < 2:\n        return grad\n    for i in prange(n):\n        xi = xs[i]\n        g = 0.0\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j:\n                dx = xi - xs[j]\n                adx = abs(dx)\n                # -s * sign(dx) * adx^(-s-1) == -s * dx * adx^(-s-2)\n                g -= s * dx * (adx ** (-s - 2))\n        grad[i] = g\n    return grad\n=======\n@njit(cache=True, parallel=True, fastmath=True)\ndef compute_grad(xs: np.ndarray, s: float = 1.0) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Compute gradient of Riesz s-energy via explicit loops (numba accelerated).\"\"\"\n    n = xs.size\n    grad = np.zeros(n)\n    if n < 2:\n        return grad\n\n    if s == 1.0:\n        # specialized path for s=1.0 to eliminate expensive pow calls\n        for i in prange(n):\n            xi = xs[i]\n            g = 0.0\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i != j:\n                    dx = xi - xs[j]\n                    adx = abs(dx)\n                    # gradient = -dx / adx^3\n                    g -= dx / (adx * adx * adx)\n            grad[i] = g\n    else:\n        # general s case\n        exp = -s - 2.0\n        coef = s\n        for i in prange(n):\n            xi = xs[i]\n            g = 0.0\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i != j:\n                    dx = xi - xs[j]\n                    adx = abs(dx)\n                    g -= coef * dx * (adx ** exp)\n            grad[i] = g\n\n    return grad\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n\n- By specializing for s=1.0, we replace `adx ** (-3)` with `1/(adx*adx*adx)`, which is much faster than a generic `pow`.\n- Turning on `cache=True` means Numba will write the compiled bitcode to disk, so subsequent runs avoid the JIT overhead.\n\nThese are localized changes that should immediately lower per-iteration cost and overall run time."]}}}
