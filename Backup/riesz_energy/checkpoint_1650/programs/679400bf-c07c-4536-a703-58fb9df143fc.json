Multi-Fidelity Trust-Region with Momentum-Accelerated Subsolvers  \n   \u2013 Alternate between a coarse \u201ccontinuum\u201d fidelity step\u2014using a smoothed far-field interaction operator accelerated via a custom CUDA FMM\u2014and a high-fidelity sketched Newton update.  \n   \u2013 Solve each trust-region subproblem in the sketched subspace via momentum-accelerated conjugate gradient, achieving high-accuracy corrections in O(rn) per iteration.\n\n5.
