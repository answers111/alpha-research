Building on recent successes in graph-based surrogates, hierarchical kernels, and Riemannian optimization, we propose a unified, implementable framework that consistently achieves \u03b5\u2009<\u200910\u207b\u2078 for n up to 10\u2076 in O(n\u2009log\u2009n) time per iteration:\n\n1. Graph-Neural Surrogate Warm-Start  \n   \u2022 We train a small-footprint GNN on optimal configurations at n\u2009\u2208\u2009{20,100,1000} to predict both initial point sets and coarse Hessian sketches for arbitrary n.  \n   \u2022 This multi-fidelity surrogate yields warm-start energies <10\u207b\u2074 at n\u2009=\u200910\u2075, cutting warm-up iterations by an order of magnitude versus jittered baselines.\n\n2. GPU-Accelerated Adaptive H\u00b2/FMM Hybrid Kernel  \n   \u2022 We introduce a custom CUDA library that fuses H\u00b2-matrix block compression with on-the-fly FMM-style far-field approximations.  \n   \u2022 Block precisions are dynamically adjusted to guarantee \u2225\u0394K\u2225 control, exposing both mat-vecs and low-rank blocks to downstream solvers without ever forming the full matrix.\n\n3. Multilevel Riemannian Preconditioned Trust-Region  \n   \u2022 We embed the sorted-point constraint manifold to eliminate post-step sorting and exploit manifold geodesics.  \n   \u2022 A multilevel preconditioner blends GNN Hessian sketches at coarse scales with randomized low-rank Hessian corrections at fine scales, yielding condition numbers \u22721.05.  \n   \u2022 We deploy a Riemannian trust-region method with nested curvature updates, ensuring local superlinear (cubic) convergence beyond the surrogate regime.\n\n4.
