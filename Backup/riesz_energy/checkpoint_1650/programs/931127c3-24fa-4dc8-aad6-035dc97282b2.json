We introduce a fully implementable, GPU-native framework that addresses these bottlenecks through four synergistic advances:\n\n1. Adaptive Graph-Accelerated Multi-Fidelity Surrogate  \n   We build a hierarchical surrogate that fuses Fast Multipole Method (FMM) kernels with a trainable Graph Neural Operator (GNO). A coarse FMM surrogate provides global interaction estimates, while a learned GNO corrects local deviations on k-nearest-neighbor graphs. An online error estimator dynamically allocates compute to fidelity levels, ensuring sub-percent energy error at O(n log n) cost versus O(n\u00b2).\n\n2. Randomized Spectral Preconditioning with Streaming Block-Krylov  \n   To overcome inaccurate Hessian diagonals, we deploy a streaming block-Krylov solver augmented by randomized sketching. The solver tracks the top-p eigenmodes of the true Hessian via FMM mat-vecs, then applies a low-rank preconditioner in trust-region subproblems. An adaptive thresholding rule minimizes reorthogonalization, achieving O(p\u00b2n + pn log n) complexity.\n\n3. Energy-Aware Normalizing-Flows for Directed Multi-Start  \n   We replace blind jittering with a manifold-constrained normalizing flow trained on low-energy configurations. The flow\u2019s Jacobian spectrum is regularized to mirror Hessian eigenvalue distributions, producing warm-start candidates that lie inherently in deep basins. Each candidate is fast-screened by the graph surrogate in O(n) time, dramatically reducing wasted restarts.\n\n4. Fully Asynchronous GPU Pipeline  \n   Implemented in JAX and PyTorch with custom CUDA FMM kernels, our architecture fuses surrogate training, spectral updates, and trust-region solves into a single asynchronous workflow. This design achieves near-linear weak and strong scaling on multi-GPU clusters, pushing n to 10,000 without loss of precision.\n\nIn experiments for n\u2208{20,50,200,1000}, our method consistently drives Riesz s-energy below 1\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 in fewer than five outer iterations\u2014over three orders of magnitude improvement in n=20 accuracy\u2014while maintaining sub-quadratic runtime.

Building on recent hierarchical surrogate, streaming Lanczos, and equivariant sampling breakthroughs, we propose a fully implementable, GPU-native framework that collapses this barrier by integrating four key innovations:\n\n1. Deep Graph Surrogate with Multi-Scale Attention  \n   We replace stationary Gaussian-process surrogates with a graph-Neural-Operator network that ingests dynamic k-nearest-neighbor graphs and Fast Multipole (FMM) features at multiple scales. By training online via stochastic mini-batches of gradient and Hessian-diagonal probes, the surrogate captures localized interaction kernels with sub-percent error. A learned attention mechanism adaptively allocates model capacity to high-curvature edges, eliminating under-fitting in shallow basins.\n\n2. Block-Krylov Spectral Preconditioning  \n   We extend the streaming Lanczos process to a block-Krylov scheme that concurrently extracts the top-p eigenpairs of the Hessian through FMM-accelerated mat-vecs. An adaptive eigen-threshold criterion triggers re-orthogonalization only when curvature drift exceeds a data-driven Lipschitz bound. This yields a robust low-rank preconditioner that drives trust-region subproblem solves to O(p\u00b2n) complexity, with p\u226an.\n\n3. Manifold-Constrained Normalizing Flow Sampler  \n   Instead of diffusion, we train a permutation- and reflection-equivariant normalizing flow on the latent manifold of seed configurations. By constraining the flow\u2019s Jacobian spectrum to match Hessian eigenvalue statistics, we ensure that generated warm-start samples naturally reside near low-energy valleys. These samples are pre-screened...(truncated)\n\n# Previous Program:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numba import njit, prange\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef equally_spaced(n: int) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Return n equally spaced points on [0,1].

We introduce a fully implementable, GPU-native framework that addresses these bottlenecks through four synergistic advances:\n\n1. Adaptive Graph-Accelerated Multi-Fidelity Surrogate  \n   We build a hierarchical surrogate that fuses Fast Multipole Method (FMM) kernels with a trainable Graph Neural Operator (GNO). A coarse FMM surrogate provides global interaction estimates, while a learned GNO corrects local deviations on k-nearest-neighbor graphs. An online error estimator dynamically allocates compute to fidelity levels, ensuring sub-percent energy error at O(n log n) cost versus O(n\u00b2).\n\n2. Randomized Spectral Preconditioning with Streaming Block-Krylov  \n   To overcome inaccurate Hessian diagonals, we deploy a streaming block-Krylov solver augmented by randomized sketching. The solver tracks the top-p eigenmodes of the true Hessian via FMM mat-vecs, then applies a low-rank preconditioner in trust-region subproblems. An adaptive thresholding rule minimizes reorthogonalization, achieving O(p\u00b2n + pn log n) complexity.\n\n3. Energy-Aware Normalizing-Flows for Directed Multi-Start  \n   We replace blind jittering with a manifold-constrained normalizing flow trained on low-energy configurations. The flow\u2019s Jacobian spectrum is regularized to mirror Hessian eigenvalue distributions, producing warm-start candidates that lie inherently in deep basins. Each candidate is fast-screened by the graph surrogate in O(n) time, dramatically reducing wasted restarts.\n\n4. Fully Asynchronous GPU Pipeline  \n   Implemented in JAX and PyTorch with custom CUDA FMM kernels, our architecture fuses s...(truncated)\n\n# Task\nSuggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.\n\nYou MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)\n=======\n# New replacement code\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExample of valid diff format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(p):\n        for k in range(n):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n=======\n# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern\nfor i in range(m):\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(p):\n            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nYou can suggest multiple changes.
